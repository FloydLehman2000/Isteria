### Early Life

Eleanor was born in Mistbarrow to a fisher’s family who worked the southern river barges. Her childhood was filled with fog, creaking floorboards, and hours watching her father repair nets, sails, and tools — she was far more fascinated by _how things worked_ than by fishing itself.  
Her mother, frustrated by Eleanor’s habit of “borrowing” and breaking tools, encouraged her to apprentice somewhere she couldn’t sink the family’s income.

### The Gearspire Years

At 14, she was accepted into the **Gearspire** as a junior apprentice, working under **High Artificer Maros Vell**. While most apprentices studied mechanics and gear theory, Eleanor learned best by _breaking things to see how they failed_.  
Her talent for unconventional solutions stood out — so did her disregard for rules. She was caught more than once smuggling prototype parts into the Cogwheel Ward for personal experiments.

She’s loyal to Maros, but she resents the Gearspire’s strict focus on preserving ancient techniques. Eleanor wants to _invent something new_ that Mistbarrow can call its own, not just restore what the old world left behind.

### The Fogcutter Engine

Her latest project is the **Fogcutter Engine** — a compact, high-intensity beam lamp capable of slicing through even magical fog. Inspired by stories of ships lost in the swamp and patrols ambushed in the mist, she designed it to keep people safe (and, admittedly, because she loves making light bend in weird ways).  
But the device’s first test run drew something dangerous from the Huddleston workshop — forcing her to abandon her workshop and leaving her invention incomplete.

---
### Personality
- **Strengths:** Creative problem-solver, mechanically gifted, unshakably optimistic even under pressure.
- **Flaws:** Overconfident in her inventions, easily distracted by “shiny” ideas, poor at following orders.
- **Quirks:** Talks to her machines as if they’re people; measures time in “tinker-hours” (“Give me three tinker-hours and I can fix it.”).

---
### Current Motivations
1. **Finish the Fogcutter Engine** — not for profit, but to prove something to herself and her mentor.
2. **Avoid Political Trouble** — the Baron’s guard keeps sniffing around the Gearspire, and she doesn’t want her off-book experiments to cause problems for Maros.

## How Eleanor Joins the Party During the Sundering Bell

### Setup Before the Bell

- The party is moving through Mistbarrow or heading toward the southern edge of town (maybe near the Cogwheel Ward or the riverfront) when they spot **Eleanor Fen** in the street.
- She’s pulling a cart with her **Fogcutter Engine prototype** strapped to it — clearly flustered, muttering about “getting it back to the Gearspire before it blows.”
### Triggering Event
- The **Sundering Bell tolls** — deep, resonant, and unnatural. The ground shudders.
- From the mist-covered swamp outside the walls, **Rustfang Hounds** begin forming from animated chains and charging toward the town’s southern gate.
- Eleanor’s reaction:
    > _"Oh no. No no no. Not now! That thing’s tuned to light, it’ll draw them right to me—"_
- Sure enough, the Fogcutter’s glow catches their attention, and the chain-beasts fix on her cart as a priority target.
### Why She Needs the Party
- She can’t move the cart fast enough alone.
- The Engine _can_ be powered up to cut through the fog and slow the hounds’ approach, but it’s unstable — she needs someone to hold off the attackers while she calibrates it.
- In her mind, the safest place to be during a swamp invasion is **with people who clearly know how to fight**.
### Bell Encounter Tie-In
- **Phase 1:** The party helps Eleanor defend her cart from the first wave of Rustfang Hounds in the streets of Mistbarrow.
- **Phase 2:** The Shackled Wraith targets _whoever is hauling or defending the Engine_ (could be a player). This becomes the fight’s central “objective,” as losing the Engine to the Wraith means Eleanor’s life work is dragged into the swamp.
- **Phase 3:** As parts of the southern boardwalk collapse and swamp water seeps in, the party must choose between holding ground to finish the Wraith or using the Fogcutter Engine to open a path for escape.
### Aftermath
If the party successfully protects Eleanor and the **Fogcutter Engine** during the Sundering Bell attack, she’s quick to repay them. Once the danger passes, she spends the next day in her workshop, tinkering non-stop. The following evening, she finds the group, oil stains on her cheeks and a wide grin on her face.

She presents them with a freshly completed gadget:
Gift: [[The Trialkeeper’s Compass]].
