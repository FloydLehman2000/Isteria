## Backstory
---
Erlenne grew up a simple follower. Her family had been part of **The Dawn Mercy**, which was definitely more a cult than anything else. Cloaked in white robes and warm smiles, its members preached grace and light, but behind closed doors, silence and submission were the law. Erlenne was taught she had to be good and quiet and live only for **the Light of Grace**, an unseen force that watched and judged every move.

Erlenne always wanted more. She asked questions, dreamed aloud, laughed too hard — all sins in the eyes of The Mercy. Being yourself meant punishment and ridicule. But worse than that, it meant her family would be ashamed of her.

She had three sisters — two older, one younger. Her older sisters were devout, echoing the doctrine like it was stitched into their lungs. They told Erlenne daily that she needed to be better for **the Coming Dawn**, and that she would never reach **Sanctified Stillness** — the cult’s supposed afterlife — if she didn't obey the rules.

Only Desily, her younger sister, saw her for who she was. Desily was sweet and kind — Erlenne’s only friend in the world.

One night, when she was nineteen, Erlenne slipped away through the thick trees hiding the grove in which her community lived. The moon lit her path, and her breath fogged in the cool air as she crossed the threshold of her old life. That’s when she encountered a group of travelers. Most of them were wary — some even reached for weapons — but one man, with skin the deepest shade of violet and horns that nearly matched his height, raised a hand and said, “Let her speak.”

They sat around a fire, and Erlenne listened more than she spoke, soaking up tales of the outside world. She learned more in that one night than in all her nineteen years under the eyes of The Dawn Mercy. When they offered to let her travel with them, her answer was already burning in her chest.

She returned briefly to the grove before sunrise. She packed a small bag, kissed her sleeping little sister goodbye, and left no trace.

The travelers became her new life. They were thieves, smugglers, tricksters — a band of rogues living by skill and instinct. They called her “soft,” at first, but taught her how to pick locks, lie, vanish in smoke, and fight with silent daggers.

She grew especially close to the horned man — **Crane**. He gave her a new name: **Atlas**. A shield to carry her pain and protect her freedom.

For months, she was free. She smiled without fear. She even thought, briefly, that maybe she was in love.

But freedom was not without cost.

One night, she awoke with her limbs pinned and panic in her throat. Her team — her _family_ — had surrounded her. She knew faerie wings sold for a high price in the underground markets. She just never thought they'd see hers that way.

The leader held the blade, whispering, “Be still, girl. It'll be easier.”

Atlas fought. She killed. She survived.

When it was done, only **Crane** was missing — vanished into the dark while she was still burying her knives in the man who'd once called her sister. He never came back.

All she managed to take was a chip of his horn, broken during the fight. She keeps it in a locket around her neck — a reminder that anyone can betray you.

Since that night, **Atlas** has made her living in the underworld, using every trick the dead taught her. She became ruthless, infamous, untouchable.

No one tries to take her wings now.

About a week before the Trials begin, **a courier slips a plain envelope** beneath the door of the tavern she’s sleeping in. There's **no seal**, **no wax**, just a folded page of thick, treated parchment.

Inside, written in clean, angular handwriting:

**Atlas,**
The Quell Trials are not what they seem.  
Someone among the High Regents has been quietly assembling assets — weapons, souls, and soldiers — off the official ledger.

**He calls himself a man of vision. I think you knew him as Crane.**

I don’t know what he’s become.  
But I know this: he’s building something.  
And I believe you’re the only one he’d hesitate to kill.

The Trials are your best way in.  
Win their trust. Enter Highthrone. Follow the echoes.

**Burn this letter. Do not look for me.**

— _A friend of the broken._
