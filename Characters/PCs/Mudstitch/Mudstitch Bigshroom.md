## Backstory
---
Mudstitch Big Shroom is a highborn bastard of a noble family Hillwarden. 

His father Droven Hillwarden, a distant descendant of the king of halflings Hamfast the Golden. Hamfast managed to subdue all the halfling families and swear fealty towards him through clever politicking and managed to amass vast lands. Which aside from the a giant food production industry for the land of Gold Barrow also lead to the development of the Toby company. The Toby company is a weed and tobacco company that is famous for being the best producers of pipe weed. Family members of the royal bloodline are all taught how to rule over the lands of Hamfast and also are all specialized experts in weed and tobacco production (as halflings are known to be avid pipe smokers).

Mudstitch, being born outside the marriage of Droven Hillwarden was granted the name of Big shroom (which in the land of Goldbarrow  is known to be a bastard name). 

His father gave him a task to do of some sort; joining the Grand Arcane Academy of Eldoria. To take the faculty of general magic knowledge and to start studying magical agriculture to increase the produce coming from the lands that were conquered by Hamfast long ago. 

But alas Mudstitch was defiant in the most unexpected way, he chose to apply for the School of War faculty to find true adventure away from the comforts of home. 

The reason for joining the school war faculty was in order to join the organization known as 

The Crimson Archive. To graduate from the School of War faculty one needs to complete a difficult task befitting one's magical abilities. Mudstitch started looking for such a task befitting of the title of his family name. That is when he came across a Quell ‘s trails poster and had an idea. So Mudstitch is bound for  two quests, completing the Quell trials and the retrieving of a family heirloom of importance to the Hillwarden family. Also of primary interest to the The Crimson Archive organization and necessary to have retrieved it in order to join 

The Crimson Archive organization. 

The name of the special item left in the possession of the Hillwardens many decades ago by the grandfather of Mudstitch is a Shield. This shield has been used by many generations as the Hillwarden (its in the name) are most usually known to be Guardians when adventuring. But alas the grandfather of Mudstitch had lost it when adventuring, cursing the day he lost it. 

This shield is known to have magical properties, which can benefit only the bravest Guardians in battle. 

MudStitch met Pyxis, she approached him as companions to do the Quest trials with. 

Why is Mudstitch a bastard? 

He was born after the death of Droven Hillwarden’s wife, a goblin born outside the country of Gold barrow. As a product of their love Mudstitch was born, having a green skin, a halfling's luck and a goblins' danger sense.
