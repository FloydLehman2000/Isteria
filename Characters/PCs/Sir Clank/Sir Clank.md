## Backstory

### Origins
Sir Clank was born a Galapa in a remote swamp village. From a young age, he was marked by violence. Human raiders, driven by the belief that consuming Galapa flesh would grant them the toughness of their shells, frequently attacked his people. These raids grew more brutal as the chaos from the Tear intensified. Firebombs, molotovs(pl.), and explosives were common. Fear was considered a key ingredient in the ritual stew they sought to create. 

Clank fled during one of these attacks. An explosion tore through the left side of his body, mangling his face and limbs. He ran until he could no longer hear his hunters. Then he collapsed. 

He was found by a half-clanker who called himself [[Sir Bibek]], a lone scout of the [[Knights of Gepetto]]. Bibek offered him a choice: live, but be changed. “You are dearly wounded,” Bibek said. “If you want to survive, I can take you to [[The Dollmaker]]. You will not be the same. But perhaps, you wouldn’t have been anyway.” Clank chose life.

### Reconstruction and Initiation
He awoke in a strange workshop, surrounded by mechanical limbs, lenses, and gearwork. The room felt more like a hoarder's room than a surgeon’s. The space belonged to the Dollmaker, a key figure in the Knights of Gepetto. The Dollmaker leads the order’s repair and maintenance division, overseeing the physical and mental upkeep of its members.

Clank’s left side was now mechanical. A new life had begun.

He joined the order without hesitation. He needed purpose. He also hoped to repay Bibek, though he never saw him again. He learned that [[Locust Knights]] like Bibek operate as scouts and recruiters. They travel alone, seeking out turning half-clankers known as [[Whales]], in hopes of bringing them back before it's too late. They also search for new candidates to join the order. Locust Knights rarely return to the headquarters, a fortified sanctuary known as [[Figaro Spire]], or simply Figaro’s.

On his first official mission, he saved a child from a burning building. This moment became a defining point in Sir Clank’s life. The child, familiar with clankers but having never seen one before, dubbed him “Sir Clank.” He chose to cast away his old name and carry this new one with pride.

He now serves as part of the general staff and has proven to be a surprisingly capable paper pusher. Recently, however, he received a direct assignment from Figaro: [[#Locate the dollmaker]] . He is likely off on one of his eccentric work excursions, chasing after some grand mechanism or forgotten cog. This task is more hands-on than his recent duties and seems to carry real importance. Sir Clank has gathered several clues pointing toward the Trial Islands as the Dollmaker’s likely destination.
### Locate the dollmaker
Per directive issued from Figaro Spire’s Inner Dispatch, Guardian Sir Clank is hereby assigned a field retrieval operation pertaining to the current unconfirmed whereabouts of the Dollmaker—chief artisan and lead engineer of Knight maintenance protocol. Though the subject is presumed to be pursuing one of his sanctioned, if erratic, research excursions, preliminary intelligence (assembled through mechanical records, requisition logs, and migratory trail analysis) suggests the Trial Islands as the most probable area of activity. Due to the Dollmaker’s essential role in both physical reconstruction and psychological stabilization among half-clanker personnel, his absence is deemed a matter of escalating operational concern. Sir Clank is authorized to proceed with all due discretion and expediency, recover the Dollmaker if found, or, failing that, establish a verified trail. Note: This task supersedes routine deskwork and is considered of high strategic priority.

### The Half-Clanker Struggle
During his early days as a new recruit, Clank learned that sanity is a constant struggle for half-clankers. Full clankers can live indefinitely if they are maintained. Half-clankers, by contrast, are torn between the logic of the machine and the instincts of the mortal body. One side seeks eternal life through replacement. The other clings to empathy, pain, and memory. When a half-clanker begins to lose their mind, they are said to be “whaling.” Like a whale, they dive deep. If they cannot surface, they become “donkeys”; lost causes, unpredictable and no longer capable of reason.

The terms carry symbolic weight, and rumors say their roots lie in a long-lost text preserved deep within the order’s restricted archives: The Adventures of Pinocchio. In it, a puppet is swallowed by a whale and later transformed into a donkey. Whether the book is sacred scripture, forgotten allegory, or mere myth remains a matter of debate among the knights.

Regardless, one principle is clear; truth is the key to mental stability. Half-clankers who lie too often fall apart faster. The Knights of Gepetto enforce this belief. Truth is not only a virtue, it is survival.
