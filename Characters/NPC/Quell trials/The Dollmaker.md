_The Bound Architect, Father of Clanks, Prisoner of Highthrone_

---
### 🧍 **General Profile**
- **Age:** Elderly by Galapa standards; exact age unknown, estimated several centuries.
- **Ancestry:** **Galapa** (turtlefolk)
- **Appearance:** Broad-shelled and stooped, his once-polished carapace now etched with arcane sigils and stress fractures from forced experimentation. His eyes are gentle and luminous, perpetually tired. Metal braces, tubes, and arcane conduits are grafted into his own body — not by choice, but necessity.
- **Aura:** Profoundly unsettling in stillness. Being near him feels like standing beside a sleeping engine — vast potential, restrained by suffering.
- **Mannerisms:** Slow, careful movements. Speaks softly, often apologizing mid-sentence. Frequently pauses as if listening to machines no one else can hear.

---
### 📖 **Origins**
- Once the greatest **mechanical architect** of the Clank era.
- Lived in isolation, rarely seen, known only through his works.
- Revered as a **messiah** by the **Knights of Gepetto** — a brotherhood of mortals saved through mechanical and arcane augmentation.
- His creations were never meant to dominate or destroy:
    - Failing hearts replaced.
    - Crushed limbs reforged.
    - Dying minds stabilized.
- When the fusion of **arcane energy and machinery** was discovered, the Dollmaker dedicated himself entirely to **giving people a second chance at life**.

---
### ⚙️ **The Knights of Gepetto**
- A voluntary order formed around the Dollmaker’s philosophy.
- Members ranged from lightly altered to nearly full clank — all united by survival through craft.
- They brought the wounded, the dying, and the forgotten to the Dollmaker’s hidden sanctum.
- For a time, **everyone returned healed**.

Then they didn’t.

---
### 🔗 **The Abduction**
- As the Knights grew in number and notoriety, **Thorne Quell took notice**.
- One by one, those brought for salvation **never returned**.
- The Knights believed the Dollmaker had turned cruel.

He hadn’t.
He had been **captured**.

---
### 🔥 **Forced Creations**
- Imprisoned in secret by **Thorne Quell**, the Dollmaker was coerced into creation under threat of extermination of the Knights.
- His forced works include:
    - **Krallax**, the engine-beast at the heart of the Quell Trials.
    - The **Heartbound Device** embedded in **High Regent Caelith Veyron**.
- Each creation stripped something from him — not physically, but spiritually.
- He learned that genius, when chained, becomes catastrophe.

---
### 🏰 **Current Imprisonment**
- Held deep beneath **Highthrone Palace**, in warded dungeons known only to Caelith and her inner circle.
- Forced to design:
    - Weaponized clanks
    - Altered beasts
    - Experimental soldiers
- Every creation is watched. Every refusal punished.
- The Knights of Gepetto believe him dead — or worse, corrupted.

---
### 🎯 **Goals**
1. **End His Captivity**, even at the cost of his life.
2. **Destroy or Disable Krallax**, his greatest shame.
3. **Undo the Heartbound Device**, if only once — to prove it can be done.
4. **Save the Knights of Gepetto**, if any still live.
5. **Ensure His Knowledge Dies With Him**, rather than be used to enslave the world.

---
### 🕸️ **Methods**
- **Subtle Sabotage:** Designs flaws only he understands — dormant, waiting.
- **Misleading Blueprints:** Leaves out vital steps, disguised as minor omissions.
- **Mechanical Mercy:** Builds fail-safes into forced creations whenever possible.
- **Silence:** Speaks little to captors, saving his truth for the day someone listens.

### ⚖️ **Philosophy**

> _“A machine reflects the hand that built it.  
> If it becomes a monster, the fault is not the metal — but the chain.”_

The Dollmaker does not seek revenge.  
He seeks **release**.

The Dollmaker believes **no life should be reforged without consent**.
And the world is breaking him for that belief.
