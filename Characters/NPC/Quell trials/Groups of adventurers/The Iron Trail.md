## Backstory
---
The Iron Trail was forged in blood and wilderness — not as adventurers, but as survivors. Years ago, the group served as elite trackers for a noble house in the region of **Goldbarrow**, a forest-kingdom.

When the house that employed them stopped funding them under political scandal, the rangers found themselves hunted — scapegoated and exiled. They survived by doing what they did best: tracking, surviving, and killing.

They became mercenaries, then bounty hunters, and eventually something more. Now self-governed, the Iron Trail acts as a neutral force, bound not by laws or gods, but by a shared code: _Hunt the dangerous. Survive the impossible. Uncover the truth before others twist it._

They’ve been watching the Quell Trials from the shadows for years — not interested in glory, but in what’s _hidden_ behind the pageantry. The magic. The buried history. The corruption that always seems to follow those in charge.

The infestation at **Vael’s Hollow** is the sign they’ve been waiting for — something unnatural is growing at the heart of the Hollow, and The Iron Trail believes it could be the source of **Flickerfly corruption**… or worse.
