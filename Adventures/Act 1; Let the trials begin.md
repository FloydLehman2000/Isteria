# Let the trials begin

## Prologue
--- 
In a landscape filled with clouds and floating islands Isteria was nothing more then a magical cluster of hussled landscapes, climates and races. From snowcapped mountains to humid jungles, all floating miles apart from each other, each having their own climate, culture and landscape. Ever since The Ascension the people of Isteria had to adapt their means of travel and crossing from island to island, some built bridges, some reinvented travel by means of airships. But adapt they did, until a new challenge arose, The Tear, which arose on the continent that is now called Ruptured Verge. The Tear is a gateway the size of tens of islands that opens up into an unknown world. The only known information gathered by the lookout near The Tear was that there were winged creatures entering Isteria from this gateway.

Ten years after The Tear the people of Isteria grew worried. The winged creatures grew increasingly bold in their raids of island settlements, so Isterians needed to think of new ways to defend themselves. Some built ballista's the size of houses, the more skilled magic users crafted new spells to fight these creatures. Much news of attacks and sightings of these creatures kept many people worried in their homes. No new invention or effort of attack was able to stop the panic or stop the creatures from entering. But there was one man who sought to create the ultimate defense, made with no weakness and no fear. Thorne Quell created The Quell Trials. Made to quell the weakness out of the most skilled warriors and mages to make the ultimate defense team.

Thorne Quell created the Quell trials, they combine all the dangers of the creatures that have appeared. Like dealing with fire and other gasseaus attacks, strong winds, areal battles and many more. He created these trials for the sole purpose of creating a team of adventurers that can stand up to this unknown and new threat. About 10 years ago Thorne Quell started the Quell initiatives, they started out with a bad reputation for having an unsafe work environment. Many people in his workforce passed away through "unknown" circumstances.  But eventually he got the fame he wanted by presenting the Quell trials, offering the solution to the ongoing threats and dangers of these new creatures.

The island is made to search for your weaknesses and eradicate them. The Islands are divided amongst 6 regions: North Varnhal, South Varnhal, North Embrath, South Embrath, Greymoor Reach and The Jagged Cage. Each of them having their own climates and magical effects.

And so, many adventurers signed up for the trials. You amongst them. Many of them trying to prove something, but also some curious about what his "initiative" is all about. The Quell trials works as follows:
- Only one group of adventurers can be the winner.
- You win by slaying "Krallax" On the most northern island
- For each opposing team you defeat you can gain special items and money
- You can gain money by completing quests given by the Trials Companion or Quests given by residents
- You can request the following things from your Trial Companion:
	- Direction and distance in travel time of the closest adventurers team (1 Bag)
	- Clue about a secret on the Islands (1 Bag)
	- Direction and travel time to the nearest settlement (Abandoned or not, 1 handful)
	- Advice on a certain adversary (1 handful)
	- Fast travel to any settlement that you have been to (5 bags)

In your adventure to become the strongest team that is participating in the trials, every team will get a Adventure Companion. This is an elemental creature that lives in a pocket dimension, you can summon your creature at ANY time using your summon stone, but beware, your companion CAN die. So not only protect but also think carefully about when you summon them.
