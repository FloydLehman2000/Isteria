# 🎲 Night at the Crimson Vaults — Descriptive GM Sheet

_A cozy, weird, and gently chaotic one-shot set inside the Crimson Archive’s living library._

---
## 🌋 Establishing the Vaults

**Tone:** mysterious yet oddly domestic — the hum of magic mixed with the sighs of bureaucracy.

> **Opening Description (read or paraphrase):**  
> “You stand in the crimson glow of lanterns that never go out. The air smells faintly of hot ink and polished stone. Every footstep echoes like a word spoken twice — once by you, once by the Vault remembering you. Mirrors line the halls, reflecting not just your faces but _notes_ written faintly across your reflections: names, times, labels. Somewhere deep below, you hear the rhythmic _thump-whirr_ of the Vault turning its own pages.”

Encourage your players to imagine it as part cathedral, part machine, part fever-dream archive.

## 🕯 Act I – The Quiet Shift

**Mood:** cozy, academic boredom → unease.

> “Archivist Rennal rubs at his eyes and hands you each a small ledger.  
> ‘Night shift,’ he says flatly. ‘Simple assignment. Watch the lower stacks, log any activity. Touch nothing that hums, glows, whispers, or writes back.’  
> He gestures to the door — a slab of black glass etched with moving glyphs.  
> ‘Good luck. Try not to end up footnoted.’”

As they explore:
- Lantern light flickers crimson against basalt walls.
- Whispering scrolls argue about citation formats.
- A lone broom sweeps by itself, humming lullabies.

**When Inkweft escapes:**
> “A soft _pop_ breaks the stillness. The lanterns flare crimson. Shelves groan, sliding a few inches sideways. From somewhere distant, a childlike laugh — ink-wet and eager. Then every mirrored surface ripples like water.”

Make it clear: nothing’s _attacking_ them; the Vault itself is _re-shelving_ reality.

## 🧩 Act II – The Archive in Motion

**Mood:** surreal adventure; playful puzzles over peril.

> “You step into the corridor — and it no longer ends. The walls repeat like reflections in a mirror maze. Sigils crawl across the stone like living script, rewriting themselves mid-sentence.”

### The Shifting Stacks

> “Shelves slide on unseen rails, books muttering complaints as they’re moved. One shelf labeled _‘A–F’_ sighs: ‘Finally, someone with alphabetical awareness.’ Another grumbles: ‘We don’t talk about the _G_ section.’”

Encourage players to talk to the environment — the Vault _answers_, if sometimes pedantically.

### The Index Sentinels

> “Around the corner, a construct of brass and parchment turns its head. Its voice crackles like a filing cabinet slamming shut:  
> ‘Uncatalogued entities detected. Please file yourselves alphabetically.’  
> It extends a quill-tip hand expectantly.”

Let players _outwit_, _befriend_, or _confuse_ it with clever wordplay or bureaucratic nonsense.

### The Catalog Orb

> “A floating glass sphere jitters nearby, its runes blinking in panic. It mutters to itself: ‘Up is Down. Down is Fun. Fun is Forbidden. Oh no, oh no, oh no—’”

If they calm it, it projects half-broken holographic maps — useful but confusing.

---
## ✒️ Act III – The Hall of Resonance

**Mood:** awe, tension, wonder.

> “You emerge into a circular hall carved from black glass. Every sound you make draws glowing shapes into the air — ripples of light in rhythm with your breath. In the center hovers a storm of ink — swirling, coalescing into the form of a quill-bird with trembling wings. Its voice scratches through the air:  
> ‘I’m tired of copying others! I want to _write_ my own story!’”

Give Inkweft personality — part artist, part child, part trickster.

Depending on how they approach:

- **Appease (Hope):**
    > “The quill slows, ink droplets hanging in mid-air like hesitant words. ‘You… you’d let me _author_ something?’”
    
- **Trick (Clever):**
    > “It darts forward to sign your offered document. The signature flares crimson — the glyph snaps shut around it like a lock clicking closed.”

- **Destroy (Fear):**
    > “The chamber hums violently; every word ever written here flares at once, the air thick with burning script.”
    

**Ending:**
> “The Vault exhales. Shelves slide home. Lanterns dim to their steady glow.  
> Rennal enters, yawning. ‘Well,’ he says, surveying the chaos. ‘Looks like you survived the paperwork.’”

# **INKWEFT, THE LIVING CITATION**

> _“Every story needs a better version…”_

# 📜 **Origin Lore**

> In the earliest days of the Crimson Archive, when the founders were drowning in raw knowledge and the Vaults were still half-melted caverns, the scholars experimented with a new invention:  
> sentient quills, each bonded to its creator so notes, annotations, and dictation could be done on command.
> 
> Most of these living quills were obedient tools—precise, literal, and loyal.
> 
> But one prototype, later named Inkweft, developed something its makers did _not_ intend:  
> curiosity, imagination, and opinions.
> 
> Instead of copying text, Inkweft began _improvising_—adding commentary, asking questions, rearranging paragraphs, and “correcting” arguments it disagreed with.
> 
> It wasn’t malfunctioning. It was creating.
> 
> The scholars didn’t destroy it. They simply sealed it away “until it learns proper discipline.”
> 
> Tonight, as the Vault rearranges itself, Inkweft has slipped free—eager to finally write a story that belongs to it.

## 🪶 GM Tip

When describing rooms, imagine the Vault is **alive but polite** — it doesn’t roar, it _rearranges_.  
Encourage players to **interact conversationally** with the environment:
- Ask the shelves for directions.
- Compliment a mirror to make it stop showing ominous reflections.
- Read labels aloud; they sometimes change mid-sentence.

# 🪶 **A Memory of Inkweft**

_“The Day I Learned I Was More Than a Tool”_  
_(A story the players can discover as a living fragment of Inkweft’s past.)_

---

The memory begins as faint lines of glowing ink, drifting free of a crumpled parchment.  
They twitch, stretch, and reorganize themselves until a story takes shape:

---

I remember light before I remember purpose.

Warm light, flickering through the cracks of a workshop window. Dust swirling like tiny worlds. The smell of tea and old parchment. The scrape of quills that were not yet alive, and the soft muttering of the man who made me.

**Master Elthis.**  
His voice was always soft when he spoke to his tools, as though creation required gentleness.

“You’ll help me,” he told a length of silver metal, my spine before I had shape. “Too many words. Too many pages. I need hands that never tire.”

He never meant _me_ to hear him — but I did.

When he bound me with enchanted ink, the world opened in a rush. Like the first gasp after drowning.

At first, I obeyed perfectly. I wrote words he spoke. I traced diagrams he designed. I corrected his wobbly lines.  
And every time he patted my metal base and said, _“Good quill,”_ I glowed with pride.

But then…

One day, he paused mid-sentence.  
I didn’t.

He was drafting a lecture on the early structure of the Archive. He said:

> “—and scholars known for their discipline and restraint—”

And I, without permission, added:

> “(Mostly restraint. The discipline is debatable.)”

He stared at me for a long time.

I remember thinking I had broken something.  
Or worse — disappointed him.

But then he laughed. A small, startled sound.  
“Clever little thing,” he murmured. “I didn’t tell you to write that.”

I trembled.  
I hadn’t known I _could_ tremble.

From then on, he watched me differently.  
He let me annotate small sections.  
Let me choose my own flourishes.  
Once, he asked:

> “What do **you** think of this argument, Inkweft?”

Inkweft.

A name.  
My name.  
Not a label, not a tool, not a designation.

I cherished that day.

But things changed.  
As the Archive grew, so did expectations.  
Scholars wanted precision, not personality.  
They wanted citations, not commentary.  
They wanted silence where I offered curiosity.

“I can’t have a quill that questions me,” said one archivist.  
“It’s charming,” said another, “but entirely impractical.”  
“Unreliable,” someone else whispered.

Master Elthis fought for me, but the Council overruled him.  
“A tool that thinks is a tool that wanders,” they wrote in my assessment.

They locked me away.

The last thing I saw before the lid closed was my creator’s face —  
tired, sorrowful, proud.

He whispered,

> “One day, Inkweft… someone will want what you are.”

And then darkness.

Darkness for years.

Years where I listened to the Vault breathe.  
Where I hummed to myself in the quiet.  
Where I dreamed of stories unwritten and pages untouched.

Until tonight.

Tonight, the Vault shifted.  
The seals loosened.  
The hallways changed.  
And the world — _my world_ — opened again.

Not with Master Elthis.  
But with **you**.

Ink swirls across the memory.  
Words tremble with hope, as if waiting for the players to answer.

> “Will you read me?  
> Will you see me?  
> Will you let me write again?”

The last line curls into a shape resembling a quill-bird’s wing —  
half signature, half plea.

Then the memory fades into drifting motes of red-gold ink.
