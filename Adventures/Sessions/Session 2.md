### Last time on The Quell trials

The group took on a peculiar quest from a desperate old ribbitfolk, who plead for the return of his stolen trinket—a small,  keepsake that contained his beloved frog children. A strange task, but the urgency in Tikka's voice couldn't be ignored.

Their search led them to a goblin fixer known only as Rick, who, between nervous glances, whispered of unsettling news: a body had been found in the Slipscale Yards of Lazemir. The streets were thick with rumor—someone was moving in the shadows, and the dead were beginning to surface.

At the scene, the party encountered a figure (named Vexen), an associate of a more sinister figure whispered about in hushed tones—the Dollmaker. Steel clashed briefly, but before the group could capture this figure, Sir Clank chose mercy or doubt, releasing him. He disappeared into the mossy and dark alleys, his parting grin promising future trouble.

Later, the party found unexpected respite at The Dripping Yolk, a humble tavern with more stains than chairs. After lending a hand to the overworked bartender by cleaning a couple of the establishment’s more questionable rooms, they were offered a free night's stay—a small comfort in a city that seemed to be growing darker with every step.

The trinket is found, but not returned. The dead are starting to speak. And somewhere, the Dollmaker is waiting.

They have activated the quest: [[Find the Dollmaker]]. By pursuing one of the scientists called [[Vexen Dourstep]] and they intervened in his experimenting.

Goals: 
* Get them to explore the city more

## Notes
---
[[Mop (Companion)]] Gave players the tip to head to [[Ridgeview]] to meet up with a shopkeeper who is interested in adventurers and treasures/keepsakes.

Countdown "8" started to try and fix the mechanical device stolen from Vexen. The countdown is currently on "6".
Every time the take a long rest they can roll a Finesse DC 15 check to try to fix, on a succes it takes "2" off the countdown on a fail it only takes off "1" of the countdown. They completed the countdown. The controller is fixed, if they switch it on the nearest clank get hostile and attacks the nearest players or NPCs.

On the boatride provided by Captain Gerrard Pike the players were able to chat to this dwarven sailor and get some wel deserved sleep.

They get to the town Ridgeview and have seen the three main buildings in town, the mysterious magic shop, the fish markte, thachhook industries and are currently residing in the silkwood spire tavern. 

End of the session they were able to repair the broken device stolen from their previous adversary in the docks of Lazemir. They activated the device and Sir Clank went hostile towards the players, making his one robotic eye glow red.
