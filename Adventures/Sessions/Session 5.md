## Recap
Fresh from the harrowing mystery of the **Purple Tower**, the party stood weary but triumphant. Xander, an old adventurer they found within, confessed he had been lured there by rumors of another great quest — a false promise that turned out to be a trap set by the Vaelen Duskthorn. Too old to fight, too proud to admit it, he passed the torch — and the danger — to you.

Among the rewards of that strange place was a **purple runic blade**, now in the hands of **Atlas**. During the party’s first rest, while others slept, she heard it whisper. A sentient voice echoed in her mind, calling itself **Shardreaver**. It spoke of memory, of hunger, of a past wielder named **Vaelen Duskthorn** — a name that stirred something deeper. The sword and Atlas are now linked.

Back in the real world, the group finally settled on a name:  
🧹 **The Cleaning Crew** — a name Mop the magical broom cheered for like it had waited its whole enchanted life to hear it.

As thanks for helping with his quest, Mop gifted the crew the **Looking Glass**, a single-use magical lens that revealed the closest rival adventuring party:  
**The Iron Trial**, heading toward **Vael’s Hollow**, just four hours ahead.

The party followed, crossing a surging river — **Sir Clank** masterfully navigating the currents while the rest took to the skies.

They arrived at the **Firebreath Sanctuary**, a dust-covered sanctuary watched over by **The Watcher**, a towering old Giant and one of the very first participants in the Quell Trials. Over a warm fire and a shared meal after hunting, he told tales of **Vael Terec** — a mythic warrior said to have once wounded the beast that now sleeps beneath **In the Jagged Cage**,  its heart Blooming in Vael's Hollow an ever-growing, magical tree.

But the Hollow has long been abandoned, thanks to a dangerous infestation of **Flickerflies** — volatile, fae-born creatures no one dares face…

## Notes

Possible Adversaries:
Juvenile Flickerfly x2
Group of adventurers: [[The Iron Trail]]

If the characters approach [[Vael's Hollow]].

Work on a project started: Teaching Atlas how to read. (Countdown 10) Dif. 12 

After saying goodbye to their giant friend, The Watcher. They marched towards Vael's Hollow. Expecting to fight two flickerflies, waiting to be disturbed. They engaged quitly, only to be found quicker then they imagined. Forgetting that The Iron Trail was near this direction they entered combat with the two territotial Flickerflies, engaging in slashin of wings and arial combat, they were triumphant. But, during their fight some unexpected animals and adventurers showed up. The Iron trail waiting for the beasts to be weakend came in for the killing blow. After the flickerflies were destroyed The leader, Caelen, told the party to give them money for not slaughtering them. In a discussion they settled on a 1v1, Atlas Versus Brynn, They faught valiantly, Brynn having the advantage of his companion bear. But Atlas won, and as soon as Atlas was to endulge in Brynn's Death, Caelen stopped the fight. Retreating, Atlas saw an opening and succumbed to the urges of Shardreaver and slit Brynn's throat, Sucking the life out of him. With Three adventurers remaining in The Iron Trail, thjey retreated to bury their dead, promising if they ever came across The Cleaning crew again, they would slaughter them.

Upon entering Vael's hollow they got to the portal, Guarded by The Sentinal, A guard only wanting a story of truth, And so Sir Clank told a small part of his backstory, a mechanical portal with a purple rift. After seeing the memory of Vael Terec they appeared once more, in a different wet stone room.
