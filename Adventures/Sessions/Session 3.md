## Last time on the Quell Trials
After leaving the shadows of Lazemir, the companions found themselves once more guided by Mop— their ever-eager companion—who pointed them toward the town of Ridgeview. There, he said, a curious shopkeeper had taken an interest in keepsakes, treasures... and adventurers bold enough to bring them.

But danger followed close behind.

The strange mechanical controller pried from Vexen's possession still pulsed with arcane machinery, ticking ever downward. **Countdown "8"** began—each long rest an opportunity to unravel its mystery. Tinkering fingers and focused minds worked tirelessly to decipher the device, finally completing the repairs just as the number dwindled to zero.

The controller was whole again—but its purpose was anything but harmless.

With the device now active, the party had a decision to make. And curiosity, as always, won out.

During a quiet boat ride provided by the gruff yet warm-hearted dwarven sailor, Captain Gerrard Pike, the group found a moment's peace. They shared tales, sharpened blades, and finally caught some well-earned rest beneath the creak of timbers and the lull of river wind.

Ridgeview awaited—a modest town nestled between misty ridges and forested slopes. The party explored its few key landmarks: the enchanting glow of the **mysterious magic shop**, the lively clamor of the **fish market**, and the cold, metallic hum of **Thatchhook Industries**. For now, they took shelter in the cozy common room of the **Silkwood Spire**, its spiced mead and velvet chairs a welcome change from cobbled streets and iron grates.

But comfort is a fragile thing.

As night fell and the repaired controller hummed to life, the air turned electric. They flipped the switch.

Sir Clank—their steadfast metallic ally—jerked to attention. A low whirring came from deep within his frame. His lone eye flared crimson, casting an eerie light across the room. With a grinding twist of his armored limbs, he turned not to guard, but to _hunt_.

**The puppet had been rewired. And the strings are being pulled.**

## Notes

They discovered that Sir Clank goes into his Bloodwake state when this mechanical box is activated. They broke this box. and Sir Clank returned to his original and self concious state.

After getting into an small argument they went ahead and talked to the owner of the silkwood spire, Xander. His local rowdy client Robin was asleep on the floor. Xander could not talk to them about the strange purple stone pillar outside. So the group went on an investigation, quickly discovering that Xander, the barkeep owner, had a key that fit in the door of the building. A feather key, traded by Sir clank giving his mace, unlocked a mysterious plot for the characters, As Mudstitch went in first and got seperated, Sir clank followed soon after, also seperated. However, pyxis and Atlas went in together, making sure they were safe with their flying abilities. Upon entering the building they saw a magnificent enormous inside, filled with bookcases and trinkets alike, creating a mazelike interior enlightened by blue crystals floating in the sky. More stuff was floating in t he sky, and Pyxis was one to grab and aquire a nice axe out of many of these items. Upon talking with the owner and wizard upon this shop, they figured out that sir clank and mudstitch were talking to two identical figures, turns out that they were dealing with Vaelen Duskthorn, an ancient wizard specializing in the binding of souls and corrupting magic. In a merchant deal that was ongoing between Sir Clank and Vaelen, Pixis and Atlas notcied something strange inside the main crystal at the - what seemed to be - mechant counter, two figures inside the crystal, upon seeing that they broke out into a fight. Smashing the crystal and toppeling their first big foe. But not without Mudstitch fighting for his life. After the battle was over they found Xander, in this very crystal and Robin, Robin unfortunatly having passed away in battle, they managed to escape the crumbling building and escape, together with Xander.
