They took a quest from Tikka Renshaw, to retrieve his stolen trinket with his frog children in it.
They approached [[Rick Fazbo]] the goblin and heard of a dead body at the Slipscale Yards in [[Lazemir]].

The dead body of a citizen, then engaged in an encounter Vexen Dourstep. One of the accomplices of The Dollmaker. Sir Clank released him and he Fled.

They decided to help out the bartender in The Dripping Yolk. They stayed the night for free for cleaning the two rooms.
