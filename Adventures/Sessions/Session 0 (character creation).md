## Player start
---
You stand in a circular stone room with a wooden floor. Lanterns dimly light the space around you. As an etherial voice sounds through the chamber you hear: "Ladies, Gents or somewhere in between. Welcome to the Quell trials. You have all signed up for a once in a life time quest. A quest to become the Defenders of Isteria. I would like to thank you for signing up, and welcome you to my magnificent creation i call The Desolate Chain. 20 other groups mirror your ambitions as you try to win the prize of pride and honour. Each one of you has got an assigned companion to travel with. He can answer most questions and supplies you with knowledge, if payment is required. You will find a handfull and a bag of coin in your labeled satchel." As the voice brings you more information, you notice a small trapdoor in the north corner of the room. Then, the voice resonates even louder: "Dearest adventurers, show me what you got!" The voice stops and a loud mechanical screech sounds from all around you.

The noise dies down, as a fiery rift opens up in the room. A fire elemental janitor steps out: "Hey guys, gosh im so glad i got paired up with you all. Trust me, i've seen some real terrifying groups." As he throws his mop on his shoulder he says: "Im Mop, im your HOT *winks* new companion. I hope we will get along and have a great adventure together! Just for your information, i can only give you your directions if you pay - Says the bossman - I hope you can forgive my rudeness about the payment but i really want to keep my job. What are all your guys' names?"

Time for Improv!
