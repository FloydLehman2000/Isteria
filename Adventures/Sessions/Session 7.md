## Recap
After spawning in a musty dungeon the cleaning crew looked for a way out, carefully they treaded stairs into a holy chamber of the Gearspire. The party made contact with **Maros Vell**, the priestess–mechanic of the **Gearspire**, who warned them that the mists were growing thicker and that night travel had become especially dangerous.

Heeding her words, the group made their way toward the local inn in **Mistbarrown**, only to stumble across **Eleanor Huddleston** — a nervous but ingenious goblin tinkerer obsessed with mechanical constructs. Eleanor was in trouble: ambushed on her way back from the Gearspire when the **Sundering Bell** rang out. Chained wraiths and animated chains ascended, but the adventurers fended them off, rescuing her in the process.

Safely reaching the inn, the group settled in for the night. Conversation quickly spiraled from talk of religion to more questionable topics — butts, boobs, and even comparing their own, uh… physical attributes (with **Mudstitch** sadly discovering he’s “below average”).

Their crude but hilarious debates stretched into the night until morning came with a _bang_ — literally. A tremendous boom cracked the early dawn as Eleanor fired up her **Mistcutter Engine**, only for it to explode spectacularly, rattling the tavern and waking the entire town.

Now, groggy and sleepless in a tavern full of equally tired patrons, the party faces a new day in Mistbarrown — and perhaps the consequences of last night’s chaos.

## Notes

Brig Skradg, missing.

At the end of the sesh the players got captured and put into the fighting arena in [[Ironfell]]. There they battled it out to the death, they are currently still on low health and trapped after an introduction to the leader called [[Crane]]. The session ended with them getting trapped through one of the trapdoors in the arena. Brig Died fighting in the arena.
