## Recap
The party’s journey through **Mistbarrow** began under a growing sense of unease. After making contact with **Maros Vell**, the priestess-mechanic of the **Gearspire**, they were warned that the encroaching night mists had grown dangerous and unpredictable. Despite this, the group pressed on, seeking shelter at the local inn.

On the way, they encountered **Eleanor Huddleston**, an anxious but brilliant goblin engineer obsessed with mechanical constructs. When the **Sundering Bell** rang, Eleanor was ambushed by a chained wraith and animated chains. The party intervened, managing to fend off the threat — at least temporarily — before escorting her safely back toward town.

That night in the inn was long and loud. Conversation drifted wildly between theology, personal histories, cult doctrine, and less dignified topics, including irreverent comparisons and crude humor that left everyone slightly more bonded — and slightly more embarrassed. Atlas’ past with **The Dawn Mercy** surfaced in fragments: the Light of Grace, Sanctified Stillness, strict obedience, and excommunication for dissent. Exhaustion eventually took them.

Morning arrived violently. Eleanor, attempting to demonstrate her **Mistcutter engine**, detonated it instead — shaking the inn awake and leaving the party groggy, sleep-deprived, and unaware that worse events were already in motion.

The group was captured and dragged into the infamous bloodsport arena of **Ironfell**. Forced to fight for the entertainment of unseen elites, they battled under brutal conditions while already wounded. During the chaos, **Brig Skradg** fell in the arena, dying in combat. The survivors were introduced to **Crane**, the shadowed figure pulling Ironfell’s strings, before the floor beneath them gave way. The session ended with the party plunging through a trapdoor — battered, imprisoned, and very much at Crane’s mercy.

## 🌒 Flashback: The Night Crane Left

_Cold earth beneath her back. Too still._

Atlas wakes to weight on her arms, a knee across her thigh. The fire is low — embers instead of flame. Shadows move where friends should be.

Someone says her name.

A blade glints.

> “Be still,” a voice whispers. “It’ll be easier.”

Her wings ache before they’re even touched. She understands before she wants to. There’s panic, then fury — sharp and blinding. Knives come free. Blood hits the dirt.

The camp erupts.

She screams. Someone else does too. There is no order, no mercy — only survival.

When it’s over, bodies lie broken around the fire. Familiar faces stare at nothing. Hands she once trusted never move again.

Crane is gone.

No footsteps. No sign of a struggle. Just absence — clean, intentional.

She finds him only in what he left behind:  
a **broken shard of horn**, snapped during the fight.

The fire dies completely.

## Crane’s Monologue — Ironfell, Now (Revised)

_Footsteps echo along the stone. The sound of keys, slow and unhurried._

> “You’re alive.”

Crane stops outside the cell, studying the group like inventory rather than prisoners.

> “That already puts you ahead of most people who come through Ironfell.”

He gestures vaguely upward, toward the arena.

> “This place survives on contracts.”  
> “Some loud. Some quiet. Some written in ink, others in blood.”

A pause.

> “One of mine went unpaid.”

His eyes move briefly to Atlas — not lingering, not softening — then away.

> “Highthrone Bastion. Respectable address. Clean ledgers.”  
> “The kind of people who believe proximity to power is the same as protection.”

He folds his hands behind his back.

> “They took Ironvein resources. Ships. Silence. Time.”  
> “Then decided they were finished owing anything at all.”

A faint, humorless smile.

> “That’s not how trade works.”

He steps closer to the bars.

> “So here is the situation, plainly.”

> “You can recover what’s owed.”  
> “No banners. No witnesses. No questions.”

> “Or—”

A glance upward again, toward the sound of distant metal.

> “—you can fight.”

He straightens, already losing interest.

> “Either way, the account is settled.”  
> “The only difference is whether you walk out of Ironfell afterward.”

Looks to Mudstitch:

>“Your family is very good at forgetting things.”  
>“I’m not.”

As he turns to leave, one final line, almost an afterthought:

> “Decide quickly. Highthrone doesn’t stay patient when it thinks it’s untouchable.”

### 🧾 Ironvein Debt — Quick Pointers (Revised)
1. The debt is owed by **Caldrin Hillwarden**, a distant cousin of the Hillwarden line.
2. Caldrin operates as a **licensed trade broker** in **Highthrone Bastion**, far from the family spotlight.
3. He used Ironvein ships to move **Toby Company pipe-weed** off-ledger to bypass High Regent tariffs.
4. Payment was promised after the shipments cleared — **it never came**.
5. Caldrin assumes his name offers protection, but his distance from the family makes him expendable.
6. The party is used because they are **deniable** and not publicly tied to Ironvein.
7. Caldrin can be found through a **dockside clerk** or a favored ledger-tavern near the Bastion ports.
8. Acceptable collection:
    - Coin (2 Chests) **or**
    - His left hand
9. Crane does **not** want Caldrin killed — he wants the message to travel up the family tree.
	1. Failure sends the party back to Ironfell’s cells… or worse.

## Notes
The party talked to Crane and got into a small contract with him. An unpaid debt from Caldrin Hillwarden needs to be paid. 
Their mission is getting 2 chests of coin or his left hand. They were sent to Highthrone Bastion to find him, their contact point is a dockside clerk.
To ensure their mission goes like asked, Crane asked the party to swallow a little crystal. He can track them but also listen to them. The party only knows this as a tracking device.

The party swiftly went through Velden's fork and Mistbarrow to get to their destination. When arriving at the North-West gate of Highthrone Bastion, Mudstitch finally put on his big boi pants and demanded entrance. They got in, but the guards did secretly give a heads up to the royal house. Now, they have two missions going in:
- A mission from their companion, Mop: Enter the city and find someone named: Nessa Volmire. She has a shipment that needs to be delivered.
- Find a dockside clerk to ask about the location or a contact to connect them to Cladrin Hillwarden.
