## Recap
After bidding farewell to **The Watcher**, their towering giant friend, the Cleaning Crew set their sights on **Vael’s Hollow**. They approached quietly, knowing two **territorial Flickerflies** were on watch. But stealth gave way to chaos — the creatures spotted them faster than expected, and the skies erupted in a blur of shredded wings and snapping mandibles.

The party fought hard, trading steel and spell for air supremacy, and just when victory seemed in reach… another threat emerged. From the waterline, the **Iron Trail** struck — four deadly rangers and their beasts, waiting for the Flickerflies to weaken before swooping in for the kill.

When the last insect fell, **Caelen**, their leader, demanded coin in exchange for letting the Cleaning Crew live. Words turned to a wager: a **1v1 duel** — Atlas versus **Brynn**, a grizzled ranger with his bear at his side. Steel rang, blood flowed, and despite the beast’s aid, Atlas emerged the victor.

Caelen called the fight, but as Brynn lay beaten, the whisper of **Shardreaver** consumed Atlas’s will. In one swift motion, she slit Brynn’s throat, the cursed blade drinking deep of his life. The Iron Trail swore vengeance before retreating to bury their dead.

Inside the Hollow’s great trunk, the party met **The Sentinel** — a one-eyed guardian who demanded a truth in exchange for passage. **Sir Clank** offered a piece of his past, and the portal’s gears stirred.

A **purple rift** tore open, pulling them into a vision — the memory of **Vael Terec**, striking but not slaying the great mechanical beast **Krallax**. The image dissolved, and the party awoke again… this time in a cold, wet stone chamber far from the Hollow.

## Sesh prep
The players are currently standing in a chamber in the undergrounds of [[Mistbarrow#The Gearspire (Church of Primara)||The Gearspire]]. They will be greeted by **High Artificer Maros Vell** asking them about how they got into the sacred chamber with Vael Terec's breastplate. She is peacefull, but sceptical. She will ask about the travellers and she will mention her apprentice.

## Notes

The group managed to communicate with the priestes/mechanic in the Gearsprie. Maros Vell being her name, she let the party know that currently it was dangerous to out in the night because of the mists growing thicker. As soon as the party went to locate the local in in Mistbarrow they came upon Eleanor Huddleston, a crafty anxious goblin who is hyper excited about mechanical constructs. She was in a lot of trouble on her way back to the Gearspire when the sundering bell rang. Ambushed by a chained wraith and animated chains the players were able to fend off the danger, for now. They headed into the local in and talked about religion, butts, boobs and much more, through the night. After a loud boom cracked the early morning from Eleanor firing her Mistcutter engine and waking up the whole town by blowing her device up on accident. they now stand groggy and tired in a tavern filled with sleepy company.

Compared penile sizes, and cupsizes. Mudstitch being below average.
Tits, great.
