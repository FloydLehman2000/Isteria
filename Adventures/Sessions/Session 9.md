## Recap
The party entered into a tenuous agreement with **Crane**, accepting a contract tied to an **unpaid debt owed by Caldrin Hillwarden**. The terms were simple and brutal: recover **two chests of coin**, or return with **Hillwarden’s left hand** as proof of payment. To pursue the matter, the party was sent to **Highthrone Bastion**, where their first lead would be a **dockside clerk** rumored to know Hillwarden’s movements.

To ensure compliance, Crane required each party member to **swallow a small crystalline shard**. The party understands it as a tracking device—but remains unaware that Crane can also **listen in** on their conversations.

Travel to the Bastion was swift, cutting through **Velden’s Fork** and **Mistbarrow** without major incident. Upon reaching the **South-West Gate of Highthrone Bastion**, tensions rose as **Mudstitch**, at last stepping into authority, demanded entry on the party’s behalf. The guards relented and allowed passage. (but not without quietly **alerting the Royal House** to the party’s arrival.)

By the time the party entered the city proper, they found themselves entangled in **two active objectives**:
- **Mop’s Mission:** Locate **Nessa Volmire**, a contact within the city holding a shipment that must be delivered.
- **Crane’s Contract:** Track down a **dockside clerk** who may know where—or how—to find **Caldrin Hillwarden**.

Highthrone Bastion now looms around them: watchful, divided, and already aware that they are here.
