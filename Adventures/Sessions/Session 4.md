## Preparation

---
The truth behind Sir Clank's mechanical fury came crashing to light.

A strange box—arcane in design and pulsing with corrupted energy—had been the key to triggering his terrifying state. When activated, the gentle clank was overtaken by crimson rage. But this time, the party was ready. With swift action, they shattered the box, and in a burst of flickering energy, Sir Clank returned to his original, self-aware self, dazed but grateful.

Relieved, but not without tension, the group shared a few heated words before deciding to investigate a lingering curiosity in the town: the **mysterious purple stone pillar** standing just outside the **Silkwood Spire**. Seeking answers, they approached **Xander**, the tavern’s eccentric owner, only to find him unwilling—or perhaps unable—to speak about it. 
The group pressed on.

A twist of fate came when a **feather-shaped key**, offered to Sir Clank in trade for his mace, fit perfectly into a hidden lock in the door of the spire. With that, the door opened, revealing a hidden building with magic humming through its bones. **Mudstitch** stepped in first—entrapped by his friends. Sir Clank followed, also disappearing. **Atlas** and **Pyxis**, more cautious, entered together, their wings ready to lift them from danger if needed.

What they discovered inside was breathtaking: a maze of spiraling bookshelves, floating relics, and blue crystal light drifting like stars above a vast magical interior. Among the many artifacts suspended mid-air, Pyxis managed to snag a beautifully crafted **axe**, glittering with potential.

But something was wrong.

As they explored, they met the supposed “owner” of this store—an elegant, poised figure. But strangely, **Mudstitch and Sir Clank** were each speaking to _the same figure_, but in different locations. It didn’t add up.

Then the truth cracked open: the party was face-to-face with **Vaelen Duskthorn**, a once-forgotten wizard steeped in soul-binding and corruptive magics. A merchant of misery. A deceiver behind the counter.

As a false deal unfolded between Vaelen and Sir Clank, **Pyxis and Atlas** noticed two flickering shapes _trapped_ within the glowing crystal centerpiece at the shop’s heart. Acting on instinct, they shattered the crystal—freeing the prisoners and igniting chaos.

The battle that followed was brutal and arcane, with **Mudstitch** fighting for his very life. But the group endured, striking down their first true foe of ancient power.

When the dust settled, they found the truth within the shards: **Xander**, imprisoned… and **Robin**, lifeless.

With the building crumbling around them and magic destabilizing, the party fled—victorious, but shaken—bringing Xander out of the ruins and back into the fading Ridgeview dusk.

## Notes
The party stands exhausted outside the purple tower. If they ask Xander for an explanation as to why he was there he was intrigued by a rumor of a possible next adventure, considering the Purple pillar. He craved for another adventure, but alas, he is not up for it anymore. For it turned out to be a trap to get him into the [[Obsidian Veil]].

As Atlas holds this strange purple runic sword, she draws to it like a moth to a flame. But soon, snapped back to reality.
During their first short or long rest, have a dialog with Atlas.
As many of you take rest and close their eyes, Atlas, you linger to look at your new item that you found, its like you hear it whispering to you.

 _It begins as a vibration — faint and low, like a distant cello string plucked in the dark. The blade hums in Atlas’s hand, not with danger, but anticipation._
 "You wield me well… for someone so unaware."

_A pause. The voice seems to curl at the edges of Atlas's mind like smoke.

"Do you hear it? The flutter behind the heartbeat? That’s not fear.  That’s **memory** — not yours. **Mine.**"

"Names are anchors, girl. But you may call me what I am...  **Shardreaver.** I have tasted the essence of tyrants and saints. I remember the heat of pyres. The cold of obsidian tombs. I have **drunk deeply.** And yet, I hunger still."
 
"Only a little truth. A little blood.  A little trust. You carry me. That binds us. But there are echoes of the one before…"

_the voice softens. A different timbre lingers — regret?
"He was... complicated. Proud. Broken. Beautiful in his failure. He wanted what you want: to kill."

"A whisper. A shadow. He tried to master me. Now, we are one. He called himself **Vaelen Duskthorn**… but that name is ash now. **I am Shardreaver. And now, so are you."**

_The voice withdrawns out of your mind, as you sit there, in the still darkness.

The group finnally came up with a name for themselves, The Cleaning crew. As they conversed with Mop, their companion, who was obviously ecstatic about this name. After completing mop's quest about the old man in the purple tower, Mop gave the players a reward, The looking glass. A glas lens that you could use one time to locate the nearest group of adventurers competing in the trials, the were 4 hours travel towards Vael's Hollow and their name: The Iron trial. 

The party followed the looking glass and crossed a surging river, Sir clank expertly navigating the waters while the other flew over with ease.

The players arrive at the Firebreath keep. The Firebreath keep is hosted by an old giant taking care of the tree and grave, his name: The Watcher. He was amongst one of the first rounds of the Quell trials making him a very old Giant. He told some stories and hunted with the group, telling them a story about Vale Terec and how the legend had it that he had damaged the beast, not knowing where or how, that was all the rumor. The story goes about Vael's Hollow that his heart got imbued with magic to make it grow into an enormous tree that would keep on his legacy. But alas, a Flickerfly infestation occurred and noone has dared to enter it's territory for a while now. He told them this during a nicely prepared meal together with his new group of friends, right after an exciting hunt for meat and some foraging.

The iron trial. A group of expert rangers that are skilled in stealth and navigation. Using their beasts as frontliners while shooting arrows from afar.
