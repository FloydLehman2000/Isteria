## The golden eel's nest
---
The Golden Eel, known to ribbetfolk as **“Beaulan’s Gilded Spine”**, is said to be a **guardian** tied to the balance of [[Lake Beaulan]]. It is rumored to molt golden egg sacs once every few decades, and those eggs contain **one boon:**

1. **Beaulan’s Breath:** Grants the ability to breathe underwater and a deep, intuitive understanding of the lake’s shifting mists.

**The Catch:**  
Taking an egg without the Golden Eel’s consent is said to curse the thief with the _Weight of the Spire_ — a slow petrification that begins in the bones and eventually leaves the victim a stone statue at the lake’s edge, their eyes forever facing the water.
Some believe that Bruggett never returned because he either consumed an egg… or chose to stay behind, either cursed or voluntarily guarding the lair from future thieves.

**The Cost: The Spire’s Weight**
If a character steals an egg or takes one without forming a proper bond with the Reverent (perhaps through an offering, choice, or roleplay trial), they invite **the Curse of the Spire.**
- Their body slowly calcifies, like stone forming under skin.
- They take a permanent Disadvantage on actions that require flexibility (physical or emotional) until the curse is lifted—or until they make reparations to the lake.

## ## **The Weeping Willow’s Secret**

### Quest Hook (Ridgeview)
In the dusty trade post of **Ridgeview**, an old traveling monk named **Eloin Patchmantle** can often be found scribbling in a cracked leather journal in the silkwood spire. He speaks of a **Weeping Willow** that stands alone in a shimmering basin, its roots curling into a hidden stone crypt beneath the water’s surface. According to local legend, the **Willow of Aurelith** weeps not for sadness, but to seal something ancient below.

Eloin is too frail to travel, but he’s desperate for adventurers to investigate. He offers a **fragmented treasure map** pointing toward the basin and whispers the name of a long-forgotten place:  
**[[Fire breath sanctuary]].**
