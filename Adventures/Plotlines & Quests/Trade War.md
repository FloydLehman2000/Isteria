The merchant lanes of the **Desolate Chain** — a dangerous expanse of fractured islands, broken bridges, and perilous waters — are the battleground for a silent but vicious trade war.  
At stake: a monopoly over machinery, ancient electronics, and clanker components — critical materials needed by the enigmatic [[The Dollmaker]].

Two guilds clash for control:
- **The Cratehands Guild** _(Lazemir)_: masters of the black-market and covert logistics.
- **The Ironvein Syndicate** _(Highthrone Bastion)_: brutal enforcers and maritime conquerors.

The Dollmaker’s allegiance will decide the victor. Whoever gains him doesn’t just win the war — they inherit dominance over the entire region’s mechanical future.

### ⚙️ The Cratehands Guild _(Lazemir)_
- **Leader:** [[Veyla Cratch]] — pragmatic, silver-tongued, plays the long game.
- **Strengths:** Subtle control of Lazemir’s waterways and ribbetfolk trade alliances.
- **Weaknesses:** Poor at large-scale confrontations, fragile naval presence.

### ⛓️ The Ironvein Syndicate _(Highthrone Bastion / Ironfell)_

- Based in the mountainous fortress-port of **Highthrone Bastion**, its jagged cliffs ringed with docks that bristle with chained warships.
- Specialize in maritime control, aggressive takeovers, and mechanical warcraft built from stolen clanker tech.
- **Leader:** **[[Crane]]** – once a rogue and smuggler, now a cold and calculating syndicate master. His reputation as a betrayer-turned-kingpin makes him both feared and mythologized. He treats every trade lane as a battlefield, every merchant as a pawn.
- **Strength:** Absolute dominance of the Desolate Chain’s sea routes through heavily armed convoys and ruthless naval tactics.
- **Weakness:** Crane rules through fear and loyalty bought with blood; betrayal simmers constantly beneath the surface, and his paranoia keeps allies at arm’s length.
