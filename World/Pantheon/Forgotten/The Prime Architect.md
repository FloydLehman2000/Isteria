## 🧍 Relationship to Mortals  
> Primara views mortals as reflections of their own creative spark — flawed yet endlessly inventive. They once guided artisans and thinkers directly, but now linger unseen, their influence felt only in moments of sudden insight or technological breakthrough.

---
## ⚔️ Relationship to Other Gods  
> Once considered the progenitor of structure and design among the pantheon, Primara’s creations often drew envy and admiration. Some deities see them as a parent figure; others as a reminder of their own impermanence.  
> After **The Ascension**, their relationships grew distant — not from anger, but resignation to divine obsolescence.

---
## 📜 Myth & Lore  
> In the **First Dawn**, before rivers cut the land and before stars found their place in the heavens, Primara walked the formless world with quill and chisel in hand. They were the **Great Designer**, sketching the universe into being: the pull of tides, the growth of trees, the spark of invention in mortal thought.  
>   
> They built the **Vault of Forms**, a celestial workshop of light and brass where every plant, beast, and mortal race was drawn, tested, and released. From Primara came not only the artistry of creation but the restless urge to improve upon it — invention was their sacred gift to all peoples.  
>   
> When **The Ascension** came, mortals turned from faith to self-determination. Primara did not rage, but faded, their blueprints dissolving into starlight as the gods themselves became obsolete.

---
## 🏛️ Worshippers & Cults  
> Only a few scattered churches and warehouses to **Primara** remain — aging halls of stone and brass, their once-grand mechanisms now silent.  
> Each is tended by only a handful of devoted followers who keep the old rites alive, not out of fear or tradition, but out of quiet reverence for the divine design that shaped the world.  
> Their prayers are rare and measured, often woven into acts of craftsmanship and creation rather than spoken aloud.

---
## 🪶 Notes  
> Some scholars theorize that the modern principle of “Creative Spark” — a mysterious energy found in advanced artifice — may be the lingering essence of Primara’s divine power.
