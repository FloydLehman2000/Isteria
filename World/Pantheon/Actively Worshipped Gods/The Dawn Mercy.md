## 🧍 Relationship to Mortals  
> Aurenia demands devotion in exchange for peace. Her light promises comfort, but only to those who submit fully. She teaches that freedom breeds sin, and that mercy lies in the stillness of unquestioning faith.  
>  
> To her devout, she is the warmth of the morning sun. To the doubters, she is the blinding glare that erases shadow and thought alike.  

---
## ⚔️ Relationship to Other Gods  
> Once allied with **Lady Luma**, Aurenia was the keeper of dawn as Luma was the keeper of dusk — together they balanced the cycle of remembrance and renewal. But when mortals turned inward during **The Ascension**, Aurenia’s compassion hardened into doctrine. Where Luma preserved memory, Aurenia sought to cleanse it.  
>  
> Her light now stands in quiet opposition to gods of freedom, chaos, and self-expression.

## 📜 Myth & Lore  
> In the age before **The Ascension**, Aurenia was the **Morning Flame**, guiding mortals from the darkness of ignorance. She taught them ritual, patience, and forgiveness — and in her mercy, they found order.  
>  
> But as time passed, her mercy became law. Her voice, once gentle, became the whisper that silenced dissent. When mortals claimed their own divinity, her radiance burned brighter, desperate to reclaim the faithful.  
>  
> It is said that her light still touches the world each dawn, a reminder of grace and control intertwined — salvation for those who kneel, warning for those who rise.  

---
## 🏛️ Worshippers & Cults  
> The faith of **The Dawn Mercy** survives as a structured, insular cult. Its members live in secluded groves or hidden enclaves, shunning the outside world. Their ceremonies are quiet, marked by songs of repentance and the ritual of **Still Light**, in which worshippers hold candles before their faces until the flame gutters out — symbolizing the extinguishing of self.  
>  
> A few larger temples exist in rural territories, claiming to offer sanctuary and healing, though travelers whisper that those who stay too long never truly leave changed.  

---
## 🪶 Notes  
> Some scholars believe that Aurenia’s “mercy” is not cruelty by nature, but the result of divine grief — a goddess who cannot bear to see mortals harm themselves, and so seeks to protect them from their own choices. Others call her the *Tyrant of Light*, a radiant mirror of mortal fear.
