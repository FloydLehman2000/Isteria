## 🧍 Relationship to Mortals  
> Lady Luma is the gentle custodian of memory — neither demanding nor distant. She watches over those burdened by loss and those who seek to preserve truth. Her blessings are subtle: a guiding light in dreams, a fleeting vision of a loved one, or a forgotten name recalled at the perfect moment.

## ⚔️ Relationship to Other Gods  
> Once close to **Primara**, she preserved the memories of the Architect’s creations when others turned away. To many gods she is both archivist and mourner, safeguarding their fading legacies in the constellations. Some resent her for refusing to let oblivion take hold; others love her for the same reason.

## 📜 Myth & Lore  
> In the first centuries of **Isteria**, Lady Luma walked the skies as both watcher and wayfinder — the quiet archivist of the heavens, gathering truths whispered in dreams and memories too precious to fade.  
>  
> She lit the way for lost travelers with the silver glow of her lantern, guiding them not only to safety but back to themselves. The constellations were her library; each star, a word in a celestial story. When a mortal’s life ended, Lady Luma would take their truest memory and place it among the stars so it would never be lost to time.  
>  
> When **The Ascension** came and mortals severed their ties to the divine, Lady Luma’s light began to wane. She did not curse them, but turned her gaze outward, wandering the dark void to collect the memories no one else would keep. Still, her presence flickers in dreams — a silver light at the edge of forgotten paths.  

---
## 🏛️ Worshippers & Cults  
> Lady Luma’s worship thrives primarily on **Luma’s Isle**, an island devoted entirely to her memory and teachings. Its inhabitants maintain libraries and sanctums filled with dream-journals, memoirs, and starlit maps — sacred archives that honor the fragments of all souls.  
>  
> Beyond the island, small shrines stand in observatories and crossroads, where travelers and scholars alike whisper her name to preserve what must not be lost.  

---
## 🪶 Notes  
> Some believe that when the last mortal forgets her own name, Lady Luma’s lantern will extinguish — and with it, the final memory of the world.
