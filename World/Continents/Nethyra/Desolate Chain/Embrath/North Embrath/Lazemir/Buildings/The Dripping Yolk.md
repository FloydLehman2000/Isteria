## Backstory & Ownership
---
The Dripping Yolk is a **half-sunken, half-patched floating tavern** cobbled together from scavenged barges, driftwood planks, and parts of old dockships. It was founded years ago by Bruggett Yolkbeard, a ribbetfolk cook with a wild reputation and a stubborn love for eel egg omelettes. When Bruggett disappeared across the lake in search of “the golden eel’s nest,” the tavern was left to his adopted kin:

Rukka’s motto: _“The Yolk don’t sink. We patch. We cook. We patch again.”_

The tavern is **always under some kind of repair.** It’s customary for guests to help fix something in exchange for a discounted stay, especially since gold sometimes rolls right through the planks and into the lake below.
## Layout
---
### Main Deck (Public Area)
- **Bar Counter** – A crooked plank bar with hanging lanterns, pan racks, and mismatched stools lashed to the floor.
- **Dining Tables** – Four tables, all different heights, with benches that occasionally list when the waves rock the tavern.
- **Kitchen Hatch** – A semi-open cooking space where sizzling eel eggs constantly crack and bubble. Spindle is usually seen darting in and out here.
### Upper Deck (Lodging)
- **Guest Rooms (4 total)**
    - _Room 1: “Broken”_ – The ceiling drips occasionally. Smells faintly of old fish, but has the best lake breeze.
    - _Room 2: “Broken”_ – Floor is slanted. You have to wedge furniture against the door to keep it from swinging open in the night.
    - _Room 3: “Fixed”_ – Surprisingly stable, but the walls creak like whispers. Locals claim it’s where Bruggett used to nap.
    - _Room 4: "Broken" – Half the floorboards are missing. This is the room currently under renovation, offered to the players to fix in exchange for free lodging.
- **Supply Loft** – Rope coils, spare planks, extra nails, eel crates. Spindle’s makeshift sleeping nook is tucked in here.
### Below Deck (Private/Storage)
- **Flooded Hold** – Waterlogged crates, soggy sacks, and mysterious barrels. Some believe smugglers use it.

[[Trade War]] – A misdelivered crate bearing the sigil of the Cratehands Guild is in storage—could lead to uncovering smuggled summoned materials. These contain electronics and machenery, under which an device that looks like a eyeball.

[[Treasures unlimited#The golden eel's nest || The Golden eel's nest]] – When Bruggett disappeared, most believed he was consumed by the lake’s mists like many reckless adventurers before him. However, tucked between the grease-stained pages of his notebook is a **cryptic clue written in his hurried scrawl:** “Where the mists neither cling nor stray, the yolk drips upon silver scales — and the ring of cracked bells will lead the way.”
