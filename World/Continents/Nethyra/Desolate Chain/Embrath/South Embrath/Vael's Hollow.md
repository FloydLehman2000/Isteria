## Lore

Vael’s Hollow is a revered yet forgotten landmark nestled between winding rivers and dense willows. The massive, gnarled tree in its center appears leafless from afar, but up close, its bark is braided and pulsating, riddled with glowing **Flickerfly eggs**.

This tree is said to be the **burial site of Vael Teren**, the famed expeditionary warrior who wounded **Krallax**. In reverence, another group of expeditioners bound his resting place with magic, protecting it from time. Over centuries, the tree grew from his buried heart, enchanted and infused with sacred energy.

Recently, however, two **Flickerflies**, drawn to the warmth of the site and its arcane undercurrent, has infested the hollow, laying its eggs deep in the trunk and high in the branches. It views intruders as threats to its brood.

Deeper within the hollow lies a **stone threshold**, guarded by a mysterious **One-Eyed Figure** known only as **The Sentinel**. The figure allows passage to only those who can **offer a story with truth**—a tale from their past that carries weight. Beyond the portal is the **Church of the Forgotten Veil**, and above it: [[Mistbarrow]]

## Encountering
The land softens as you approach — firm plains giving way to sodden ground, thick with the perfume of moss, rot, and wildflowers. The air is **unnaturally still**, as though holding its breath. Even your footsteps feel muffled.

Then, through the grasslands, **you see it.**

A colossal tree looms at the heart of a shallow, reflective lake — its branches stretch wide and weeping, draped in silvery strands of vine and lichen. This is no ordinary tree. Its **bark pulses faintly**, veins of old magic flowing through its wood like blood beneath skin. At its roots, hollow caverns yawn like mouths in the dark, exhaling a low, constant hum — like the memory of thunder.

But the beauty is corrupted.

Masses of **bulbous, pale-blue egg sacs** cling to the trunk and branches like boils, pulsing faintly with internal light. From time to time, one twitches.

Above them, circling lazily through the canopy, **two juvenile Flickerflies** drift — their wings shimmer with oil-slick color, bodies long and segmented, each the size of a full-grown horse. They move like they're dreaming… but their antennae constantly twitch, always seeking.

The hush deepens. Then—
🎲 _If anyone rolls DC 20 Instinct:_
Your eyes catch it — **movement near the far lake boundary**, just within the underbrush. Humanoid figures. Still. Waiting. Watching.

Four of them, hunched low like predators. And one of them briefly raises a glinting glass lens to their eye… before melting back into the reeds.
They're not Flickerflies.  
**You are not alone.**

🎲 _If players don't pass:_
A howl from a small gap near the trunk of the tree.

## Vael's Heart
Deeper within the hollow lies a **stone threshold**, guarded by a mysterious **One-Eyed Figure** known only as **The Sentinel**. The figure allows passage to only those who can **offer a story with truth**—a tale from their past that carries weight. Beyond the portal is the **Church of the Forgotten Veil**, and above it: [[Mistbarrow]]

When the characters enter the room with The Sentinel:
You descend deeper into the wood, the walls folding in around you like ribs made of bark and bone. Faint pulses of purple light crawl along the inner grain of the trunk, forming veins of subtle arcana. The air is warm — wet with magic and the breath of something that remembers more than it should.

At the bottom of the descent lies a **vaulted chamber**, unnatural in shape — **circular**, precise, grown **too perfectly** to be natural. This was once **touched by something not of this world**.

Vines dangle like chandeliers, swaying with no breeze. The floor beneath you is smooth, **glass-like wood**, reflecting faint silhouettes that don’t match your movements.

In the center of the chamber floats a **portal** — a **rift in space**, held open by an elegant frame of **machine-forged brass** and **twisting blacksteel rods**, studded with humming nodes of **deep violet crystal**. It’s like a doorway suspended in a standing ring, hissing with restrained force.

The portal itself is **sheer purple energy**, pulsing in steady rhythm like a heartbeat. It is not a gentle light — it is **alive**, and watching.

And standing motionless before the portal is a **figure clad in rags and plated armor**, fused into the wooden floor as if grown from it.

He is **massive**, though hunched, with a long cloak of threadbare silver moss draping from his shoulders. His face is mostly hidden beneath a stone-like helm carved into the shape of a single glaring eye.

> **The Sentinel.**

His voice, when it speaks, is a low rumble laced with root and echo, like thunder beneath the soil.

> **“No foot passes into memory unless it carries truth. Speak now. Not to impress. Not to inspire. But to be known.”**

He carries no weapon — only a **staff of fossilized root**, etched with stories you cannot read.

To pass through the portal, a character must **speak a true story** — a confession, a memory, a burden from their past that still defines them. The Sentinel watches in perfect silence, unmoving, judging not the morality — but the **honesty**.

Once accepted, the portal flares with light, opening the way to:
You’re no longer in the tree.

You’re somewhere  — a plane stitched from memory and old magic.

There, across an obsidian plain choked by dust and glowing spores, **Krallax** moves — a **mechanical monstrosity**, its limbs wheezing with cruel efficiency, plated in **forged brass, spiked iron, and veins of amethyst power**.

And there, not far from where you stand, **a lone warrior** faces the impossible.

**Vaelen Terec.**

He does not look like a legend.

He looks **tired.** Wounded. **Scorched** across his right shoulder, armor half-melted.  
But the fire in his eyes is **refusal**. He will not retreat.

> “You’re not a the end goal,” he spits. “Just a machine that forgot what it was built for.”

He hurls a javelin of radiant light — it **pierces** Krallax’s lower plating with a burst of flame. The behemoth stumbles, whines — **a weakness, exposed.**

But it’s only a **scratch.**

Krallax rears, vents flaring, and **unleashes a torrent** of energy that swallows the battlefield in blinding violet.

> “I am the end of cycles,” a voice echoes through the storm — **not spoken** but carved directly into your bones.

Vaelen falls to one knee. Bloodied, breathing hard.  
He plants his weapon like a banner.  
Then… the vision ends.

You awaken — **not from sleep**, but from something deeper.  
**A memory not your own**, stitched to your senses like a shroud.

The air is colder here.  
You stand in **stonework dungeons**, a place sunken far below — a tomb of silence and echo. The walls are slick with condensation, moss clawing through the cracks between ancient bricks. Faint, violet light bleeds from arcane veins in the mortar, pulsing like the heartbeat of something long buried.

At the far end of the chamber rests an **altar of blackened stone**,  
its surface **cracked**, seared, and scorched by a blow meant to kill — but failed.

> On top of it, lies a broken chest piece once belonging to **Vaelen Terec**.

This is not where Vaelen died.  
This is the plate of the man who made the machine **taste pain for the first time.**

And though the years have buried that battle deep beneath ash and time…  
**The beast remembers.**
