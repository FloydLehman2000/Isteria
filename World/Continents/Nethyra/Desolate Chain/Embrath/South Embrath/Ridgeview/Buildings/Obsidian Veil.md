**The Obsidian Veil**

_(Note: No one in town knows this name. It is not written anywhere and is hidden even from magical detection. It will only be discovered later in the quest.)_

---
### 🧙‍♂️ **Shop Owner:**

**Vaelen Duskthorn**
- A reclusive sorcerer specializing in arcana, Vaelen is a master of soul-binding and transmutation magic.
- Appears as a middle-aged, pale man with faint purple tattoos spiraling up his arms. His voice is calm but carries a sharp, unsettling edge.
- His motivations are unknown to most. In truth, he seeks to forge a weapon powerful enough to breach the veil between worlds.

---

### 🗡️ **The Weapon:**
**[[Shardreaver]]**

---
### 🔮 **The Process:**
Vaelen is creating **Shardreaver** using a forbidden ritual called the **Soul Siphon Binding.**  
Here's how it works:
1. **Anchoring:** The captured adventurer is magically tethered to the shop, their life force slowly drained through arcane conduits built into the purple stone walls.
2. **Memory Extraction:** Vaelen removes key memories and essence from the adventurer to infuse the blade with willpower, ensuring the weapon is "alive" and partially sentient.
The ritual is near completion, but if interrupted, it could either destroy the shop or tear open a dangerous rift (Countdown 12, starts at 8 if combat is engaged).

# 🗡️ Combat Encounter: **The Soulforger’s Last Stand**

## 🎭 Encounter Setup:

As the players breach the magically sealed entrance of _The Obsidian Veil_, they find **Vaelen Duskthorn** in the final stages of binding _Shardreaver_ to its new form. His captive, **Robin**, is suspended in a magical stasis, his life force feeding the weapon.
Vaelen is _prepared_ for intruders. The shop twists its shape around him, his power magnified by the arcane conduits running through the building.
## ⚔️ Vaelen Duskthorn – Soulforger
- **Type:** Elite Adversary
- **Health:** 20
- **Armor:** 1
- **Core Damage Die:** Dagger
- **Adversary Abilities:**
    - **Soul Bind (Active Ability, 1x/round):**  
        Target one PC within 30 ft. The PC must make a **Knowledge Save (DC 15)** or become **Soul Bound** for 1 action rounds, reducing their Speed by half and taking +1 damage from all sources. On success, they resist the bind.
    - **Shard Pulse (Active Ability, 1x/rest):**  
        Unleashes a pulse of unstable energy. All creatures within 10 ft. of Vaelen must make a **Finesse Save (DC 15)** or take **4 Damage**. Half damage on success.
    - **Rift Step (Innate Ability):**  
        As a reaction, Vaelen can **teleport up to 30 ft.** within the shop through shadowy rifts. He can do this **once per DM move**.
    - **Soul Shard Minions (Summon Minions):**  
        At the end of every other DM move, Vaelen summons **1 Soul Shard Wisps.**

---
## 👻 Soul Shard Wisps – Minions
- **Health:** 1
- **Swarm Trait:**
    - When a Soul Shard Wisp hits, it inflicts **Damage**
    - They can **absorb damage** directed at Vaelen once per fear spent (like ablative shields).

---
## 💥 Environmental Effects:
The shop itself is alive with Vaelen’s magic
- **Arcane Conduits (Hazard):**  
    Every DM move, one conduit **sparks violently.** PCs within close range of a conduit must roll a **Finesse Save (DC 10)** or take **1 stress** from the magical surge.
- **Rotating Walls:**  
    On countdown count 10, the walls shift and **block or open paths**. PCs may need to reroute or risk being cornered.

---
## 🎲 Encounter Goals:
- **Primary Objective:** Defeat Vaelen and stop the ritual before Shardreaver becomes fully sentient and uncontrollable.
- **Optional Objective:** Rescue Robin without destabilizing the shop’s magic. If the PCs simply destroy the conduits, the shop may collapse.

---
## 📜 Suggested Phases:
**Phase 1 (Control & Minions):**  
Vaelen keeps his distance, using Soul Bind and his minions to slow the party.
**Phase 2 (Rift Dance):**  
Once below half health, Vaelen uses **Rift Step more aggressively**, leaping across the battlefield and pulsing his Shard energy.
**Phase 3 (Desperation):**  
At 5 health or less, Vaelen begins a **final infusion into Shardreaver.**
- The weapon gains a protective aura (PCs must deal 3 damage in one turn to interrupt the process).
- If not stopped, Vaelen merges with Shardreaver, creating a _shadow-forged version of himself_ (GM's discretion: turn this into a second phase boss or a narrative consequence).

---
## 🏆 Rewards:

- **Shardreaver (weakened version):**  
    The PCs can claim the blade, but it is unstable. They must decide whether to destroy it or attune to it (see previous weapon card).
- **20 Bags**
