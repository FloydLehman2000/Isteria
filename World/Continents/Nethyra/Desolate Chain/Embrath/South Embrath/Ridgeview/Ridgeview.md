Ridgeview is a small, adventurous village perched precariously near the edge of the island, with fast rivers that dangerously spill over the cliffs into the abyss. Known as a crossroads for travellers, adventurers, and merchants, Ridgeview has a transient yet lively energy despite its modest size.

The village consists of a **small central square** surrounded by key buildings, cobbled paths, and scattered wooden homes. It's a melting pot of races and cultures, often bustling with those preparing for expeditions or celebrating recent victories. Ridgeview feels welcoming but carries a strange undercurrent of mystery — mainly tied to the enigmatic magic shop that no one seems to understand.

The town's edges feature **viewpoints** offering dizzying sights of the rushing rivers and the infinite drop beyond the cliffs.

### **The Silkwood Spire (Tavern)**
- **Owner:** Xander, a cheerful but sharp-witted barkeep, also in love with Frida.
- **Exterior:** Warm timber walls, vibrant hanging flower baskets, a stone foundation, and a small spire that leans slightly outward. Always busy with tied horses and adventurers’ gear outside.
- **Interior:** Crackling fireplaces, creaky wooden beams, mismatched but cozy furniture, and maps and swords hanging on the walls. The **spire houses two large rooms** reserved for high-paying guests or long-term adventurers. The tavern also has **two smaller rooms** on the main floor for overnight stays.
- **Vibe:** Always lively, sometimes rowdy. A well-known regular, **Robin**, often starts tavern games, music, and the occasional brawl.

### **The Obsidian Veil**
- Owner:
	- **Vaelen Duskthorn** ()
	* A reclusive sorcerer specializing in arcana, Vaelen is a master of soul-binding and transmutation magic.
	* Appears as a middle-aged, pale man with faint purple tattoos spiraling up his arms. His voice is calm but carries a sharp, unsettling edge.
	- His motivations are unknown to most. In truth, he seeks to forge a weapon powerful enough to threaten the industries to get him off the island.
- **Appearance:** A small, stone building with faintly glowing **purple stones** embedded in the exterior. Covered in arcane symbols no one understands.
- **Mystery:** The shop **has no name sign** and is always locked. Locals claim they never see anyone enter or leave. The door appears to hum faintly, especially at night.
- **Secret:** An adventurer is being held inside, drained to create a powerful magical weapon. The townsfolk know nothing of this.\

### **Thatchhook Industries (Fishing Store)**
- **Owner:** Run by a retired ribbetfolk fisherman named **Old Marn**.
- **Exterior:** Humble wooden building with fishnets, barrels, and drying racks outside. Smells faintly of salt and smoke.
- **Interior:** Packed with fishing gear, ropes, bait, and freshly caught river fish. Old Marn trades stories as eagerly as he trades fish.
- **Specialties:** River maps, rare bait, and sometimes illegal catches from the dangerous cliffside rivers.

### **Ridgeview Viewpoint**
- **Description:** A stone-paved platform with a rickety wooden railing perched directly over the island’s edge.
- **View:** Spectacular vistas of the fast-moving rivers that spill into the endless sky below. Adventurers sometimes dare each other to touch the raging waters as they disappear over the cliffs.
- **Local Belief:** Some say the winds at the viewpoint carry the whispers of those who have fallen.

### **Fast Rivers & Cliffside Paths**
- The rivers are swift, dangerous, and crisscross the town via wooden bridges.
- Paths lead precariously along the cliffside to small fishing spots, but only the bravest venture there regularly.
- Occasional wooden signs warn of **“swift death”** near the river’s edge.
