## Sundering Bell - Chainsnarl Rising
---
The Sundering Bell tolls, shaking the ancient prison hulks in the swamp. Black, corroded chains begin to writhe and rise from the muck, animated by old magic and the rage of forgotten inmates.

### **Encounter Phases**

**➤ Phase 1: Chainspawn Minions**  
The swamp churns as **Animated Chains** writhe upward, forming into **Rustfang Hounds** that emerge from the muck. These support minions don’t fight head-on but dart in to **mark targets** with their **Bloodscent Coordination**, making them easier prey for the Wraith to strike later. The difficult terrain and chain lash hazards immediately limit movement, funneling PCs toward the sinking swamp grounds. This phase is all about pressure and positioning — if the PCs don’t deal with the hounds quickly, they’ll constantly be set up for bigger hits.


**➤ Phase 2: Shackled Wraith**  
With the pack’s work done, the air turns icy as a **Shackled Wraith** phases through the mud, dragging a massive spiked chain that drips swamp water and rust. It prioritizes the most heavily armored PC — the one it deems “worthy of shackling” — using **Chains of the Forgotten** to summon fresh Animated Chains in strategic choke points. These chains attempt to restrain the frontline, while the Wraith uses **Soulrend Gaze** to immobilize high-priority threats and control the pace of the fight. The swamp’s difficult terrain and the Wraith’s mobility force the party to split or risk becoming trapped together.


**➤ Phase 3: Collapse of the Old Gallows**  
The swamps groan and begin sinking into the bog. At this point, zones on the map start shifting — wooden walkways collapse, chains pull structures under, and **swamp zones expand**. Any creature ending its turn in deep swamp must succeed on a **Strength Roll** or begin sinking, requiring rescue or significant effort to escape. The Wraith fights to the last here, using its **Phase Shift** reaction to dart between collapsing platforms, while any remaining Rustfang Hounds herd the PCs into the most unstable ground. If left unchecked, the battlefield itself could claim more lives than the enemies.
