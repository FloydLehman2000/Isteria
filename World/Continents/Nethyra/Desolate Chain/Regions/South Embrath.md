## Sundering Bell - VEINMIRROR RISING
---
As the **Veinmirror Rising** pulses across the desert scrublands, a caravan of glass merchants has gone missing near a fractured salt-mirror valley. The PCs are hired to investigate. What they find are **shattered illusions come to life**—creatures twisted by emotional resonance and light. Reality bends. Reflections become enemies. One of the reflections? A **dark version of a PC**, shaped by Veinmirror magic.

### Encounter Phases

**➤ Phase 1: Haunting Reflection (Illusion and Isolation)**  
The players enter a clearing filled with cracked, hovering mirror shards. As they advance, two **Spectral Archers** emerge from the fragments, firing from across mirrored angles.
- Spectral Archers use **Pick Your Target** if players group together.
- The mirror field disorients movement, causing miscommunication.
- Players may attempt **Lore or Craft Checks** (DC 14) to decipher mirror patterns and predict attack lines.

**➤ Phase 2: Guardians of Memory (Territorial Defense)**  
A **Spectral Guardian** phases through a mirror in Very Close range, attempting to lock down the frontline with **Grave Blade** and protect the terrain.
- The guardian prioritizes protecting a specific central mirror that seems to pulse with spirit energy.
- PCs can mark **Stress to shatter mirrors**, removing disorientation but risking summoning spectral echoes (minions).
- This phase emphasizes protecting allies and disrupting the ghost's guard patterns.

**➤ Phase 3: Echoes of Command (Leadership and Undeath)**  
Once a mirror shard near the battlefield center is disturbed or shattered, the **Spectral Captain** manifests with a flicker of lightning.
- He immediately uses **Unending Battle** to revive fallen Spectral allies (2d4 revived if available).
- **Hold Fast** enhances ally reactions as the pressure escalates.
- The battlefield becomes a zone of shifting spectral threats as mirrors spark with fading memory energy.

VEINMIRROR RISING ends when the Sundering Bell countdown hits "0".
