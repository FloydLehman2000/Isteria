## Sundering Bell - WILDHEART SURGE
---
As the **Sundering Bell tolls**, a pulse of ancient magic awakens the restless animals in South Varnhal. Vines stretch unnaturally fast, wildlife becomes hostile, and the forest sings with fury. The players are caught in the heart of it when a **ritual site**, meant to calm the forest's ancient heart, is instead overrun by corrupted beasts.
### Encounter Phases
**➤ Phase 1: Initial Chaos (Ambush)**  
The players are ambushed by two **Tangle Bramble Swarms**, erupting from the undergrowth. These minions aim to restrain and distract the party while calling attention to the changing environment.

**➤ Phase 2: Aerial Threat (Terror of the Flickerfly)**  
The **Juvenile Flickerfly** descends from the canopy, targeting high-Spirit characters with **hallucinatory gas** and disrupting teamwork. Use “Mind Dance” or “Hallucinatory Breath” to sow confusion.

**➤ Phase 3: Strategic Pressure (Beastmaster & Beast)**  
Once the party is weakened, the **Giant Beastmaster** enters with a **summoned Thornfang Beast**. They pin targets and force party members to reposition.  
The **Beastmaster’s Longbow** can restrain PCs, while the Thornfang leaps to harass the backline.

WILDHEART SURGE ends when the Sundering Bell countdown reaches "0".
