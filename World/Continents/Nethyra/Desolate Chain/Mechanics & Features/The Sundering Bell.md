### Lore:

Forged during the early Quell Initiatives, the **Sundering Bell** is an **arcane resonance beacon** placed in each of the six trial regions. When it tolls, it means something has disrupted the natural or magical balance of that island—something that may destroy the region, warp its magic, or corrupt the Trials themselves.

The bell doesn’t ring by hand—it activates when all of the Six Sundering Conditions is met. Each is tied to the core **theme of the region**, and a **dangerous threat** that emerges if things go too far.
[[The Sundering Bell]] is a countdown event of 6 that gets triggered after getting ticked 6 times. It gets ticked down by the following actions:
* The PCs kill a full opposing team.
* The PCs ignore a region’s core magical law.
* The PCs sabotage a Trial Guardian, ritual, or relic meant to keep balance.
* Another team is eliminated
* They make alliances with exiled, dangerous figures, other groups.
* The party retrieves or interacts with a Krallax-bound item.
* PCs ignore, violate, or intentionally exploit a pact with a Trial Companion, elemental spirit, or local settlement leader.
* The party takes a short or long rest
* Lying to a Trial Companion, They are deeply tied to the balance. When deceived about objectives, team deaths, or intent, the Companion loses trust—and their magic flickers.
* Party splits for too long, The Trials are designed for bonded adventurers. A team who splits for more then 1 in-game hour.
* Whispering a name once buried by the Trial’s lore (a fallen god, a former failed champion, or Krallax itself) causes a resonance.
* Stealing another team’s Summon Stone
