The city thins as it reaches the island’s jagged rim, stone streets giving way to ironwork, cranes, and wind-worn platforms. **Rocky Edge** clings to the cliffs like a scar, its buildings bolted into the rock, reinforced with chains and steel braces. Below, waves smash endlessly against the stone; above, **airships drift and dock**, their envelopes creaking as cargo is loaded and unloaded.

This district smells of **salt, oil, and hot metal**. Dockworkers shout over the wind, foremen bark orders, and guild enforcers linger just out of the way, watching everything. Cargo moves fast here—too fast to ask questions—and manifests are adjusted with practiced ease.

Ironvein Syndicate banners hang openly along several warehouses, marking this place as one of their strongholds within the city. Yet even here, control is contested. Every crate is counted twice, every shipment watched, and every newcomer measured for usefulness. Rocky Edge doesn’t care where you’re from—only what you’re carrying, and who you owe.

## Layout

### 🩸 Ironvein Syndicate Hideout (Rocky Edge)
Tucked into a narrow, salt-stained alley barely wide enough for two people to pass, the Ironvein hideout looks like just another **lean warehouse-office** wedged between fishmongers and rope sellers. No signage. No guards in plain sight.

**Layout**
- **Ground Floor:**  
    A sparse front office with ledgers, a desk, and locked cabinets. A false wall hides a narrow stairwell upward. Anyone lingering too long is quietly watched from nearby windows.
- **Second Floor:**  
    Meeting room and sleeping quarters for Syndicate enforcers. Windows are shuttered and sound-dampened. A hidden trapdoor beneath a rug leads down.
- **Cellar (Hidden):**  
    Cold stone storage, reinforced doors, and a concealed iron grate leading into the **sewer tunnels**. This passage is used for moving goods, people, or disappearing entirely.

Finding the place requires either **local knowledge, Ironvein contacts, or following the right person at night**.

### 📑 Dockside Clerk Station

A squat stone building overlooking the docks, filled with desks, shelves, and stacks of wax-sealed manifests. The air smells of ink, brine, and sweat.

Several clerks work here, but one matters most:
- **Senior Dock Clerk:** keeps unofficial side-records — debts, delays, “misplaced” shipments.

**Information on Caldrin Hillwarden**
- The clerk _does_ know where Caldrin was last seen and who handles his accounts.
- He will only talk for **coin**.
- **Cost:** **2 HF of Coin**
- Payment must be discreet — slid into a ledger or pouch, not openly handed over.

Once paid, the clerk provides:
- Caldrin’s **last registered shipment** which is a shipment of 2 chests filled with "Pumpking spiced breath". An form of weed, usually smoked.
- A name (Grack) that can get them to the [[Highthrone Bastion – Aureth Crown#📍 Residence **Amberveil House**]] They can meet him at the alley with a blue house right before the gate from Rocky Edge into Aureth Crown

### ⚓ The Docks of Rocky Edge

The lifeline of the city.
- **Eastern Docks:**  
    Traditional ships unload here — merchant vessels, supply barges, fishing trawlers. These routes connect directly into **Gildcross Markets**, and the air is loud with shouting, bells, and deals made mid-unload.
- **Southern Airship Piers:**  
    Reinforced stone platforms fitted with arcane moorings. These are **heavily guarded by Royal Guard detachments**.  
    Airships travel **off-island**, destinations undisclosed.

**At Present:**  
No airships are docked — only guards waiting, bored but alert. Their presence alone tells the party these ships matter.

### 🛒 Grikx’s “Totally Legit Curios”

A crooked storefront wedged between a net-mender and a shuttered tavern. Inside is chaos: shelves stacked too high, items hanging from hooks, and a goblin behind the counter who never stops grinning.

**Owner:**  
**Grikx** — goblin male, fast-talking, sharp-eyed, and absolutely lying unless proven otherwise.
> “Nothing stolen if no one can prove it, yeah?”

Grikx doesn’t know _why_ some items are valuable — but **the Ironvein and Cratehands items will absolutely raise eyebrows** if noticed by the wrong people.
