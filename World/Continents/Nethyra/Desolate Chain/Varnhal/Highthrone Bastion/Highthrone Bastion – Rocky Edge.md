The city thins as it reaches the island’s jagged rim, stone streets giving way to ironwork, cranes, and wind-worn platforms. **Rocky Edge** clings to the cliffs like a scar, its buildings bolted into the rock, reinforced with chains and steel braces. Below, waves smash endlessly against the stone; above, **airships drift and dock**, their envelopes creaking as cargo is loaded and unloaded.

This district smells of **salt, oil, and hot metal**. Dockworkers shout over the wind, foremen bark orders, and guild enforcers linger just out of the way, watching everything. Cargo moves fast here—too fast to ask questions—and manifests are adjusted with practiced ease.

Ironvein Syndicate banners hang openly along several warehouses, marking this place as one of their strongholds within the city. Yet even here, control is contested. Every crate is counted twice, every shipment watched, and every newcomer measured for usefulness. Rocky Edge doesn’t care where you’re from—only what you’re carrying, and who you owe.
