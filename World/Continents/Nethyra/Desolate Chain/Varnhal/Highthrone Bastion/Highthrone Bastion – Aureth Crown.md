The climb into **Aureth Crown** is subtle but unmistakable. Streets widen, stonework brightens, and the noise of the lower wards fades into careful quiet. Buildings rise taller here, their facades trimmed in gold-leaf inlays and living greenery, sculpted rather than allowed to grow wild. Every corner is clean. Every step feels deliberate.

Guards stand straighter in this district, armor polished, eyes sharp. Nobles pass in silks and tailored leathers, flanked by aides and quiet muscle. Behind shaded windows and private courtyards, deals are struck that reshape entire districts, all without a single raised voice.

At the district’s heart rises **Highthrone Palace**, radiant in yellow stone and green adornment, its walls both beautiful and absolute. This is where **High Regent Caelith Veyron** reigns—where law is authored, alliances are weighed, and the fate of the Desolate Chain is decided behind closed doors. Power here does not shout. It waits, confident it will be obeyed.
