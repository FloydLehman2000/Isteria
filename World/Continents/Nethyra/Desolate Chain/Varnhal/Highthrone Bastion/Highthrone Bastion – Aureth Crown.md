The climb into **Aureth Crown** is subtle but unmistakable. Streets widen, stonework brightens, and the noise of the lower wards fades into careful quiet. Buildings rise taller here, their facades trimmed in gold-leaf inlays and living greenery, sculpted rather than allowed to grow wild. Every corner is clean. Every step feels deliberate.

Guards stand straighter in this district, armor polished, eyes sharp. Nobles pass in silks and tailored leathers, flanked by aides and quiet muscle. Behind shaded windows and private courtyards, deals are struck that reshape entire districts, all without a single raised voice.

At the district’s heart rises **Highthrone Palace**, radiant in yellow stone and green adornment, its walls both beautiful and absolute. This is where **High Regent Caelith Veyron** reigns—where law is authored, alliances are weighed, and the fate of the Desolate Chain is decided behind closed doors. Power here does not shout. It waits, confident it will be obeyed.

## Layout

## 🏨 The Sunspire Concord

A towering, opulent inn of white stone and gold-trimmed glass, rising three elegant floors above a private courtyard.
- Entry is **by recommendation only** — noble seals, royal invitations, or pre-approved patrons.
- Staff are flawless, discreet, and absolutely loyal to the Crown.
- Rooms are lavish beyond reason: silk-draped beds, private baths, sound-dampened walls, and warded doors.
- Refusing service is done politely… and irrevocably.

Rumor holds that more treaties are signed here than in the palace itself.

## 🛡️ Patrols & Law in Aureth Crown

Royal Guard patrols are **constant and overlapping**.
- **Patrol Size:** 4–6 guards minimum, often led by a decorated officer.
- **Presence:** Visible at all intersections, garden entrances, and estate gates.
- **Surveillance:** Scrying sigils and watchful familiars supplement physical patrols.
### Crown Rules (Strictly Enforced)
- No open weapons unless bearing royal writ.
- No spellcasting without permit.
- No loitering near estates or the palace.
- Disputes are settled by guards, not citizens.
- Resistance is treated as treason-adjacent.

Punishments are swift, quiet, and final enough to discourage repetition.

## 🏛️ Caldrin Hillwarden — Presence in Aureth Crown

Caldrin Hillwarden maintains a **quiet but deliberate foothold** in the Aureth Crown, despite not being a prominent noble in the district. He operates on the edges of legitimacy — close enough to power to profit, far enough to deny liability.
### 📍 Residence: **Amberveil House**

A modest-but-refined townhouse tucked along a side avenue near the inner gardens of Aureth Crown.
- Officially listed as a **trade liaison residence** for Hillwarden interests.
- Guards are _hired swords_, not royal — a notable distinction.
- The house is elegant but sparse, suggesting someone who doesn’t stay long.
- Windows are warded; entrances are watched more for surveillance than defense.

Neighbors know the name **Hillwarden**, but not the man.

### 📜 His Role & the Debt

Caldrin’s unpaid debt to the **Ironvein Syndicate** stems from a **failed trade maneuver**:
- He used Ironvein ships and dock favors to move a high-value shipment through Rocky Edge **without paying syndicate tariffs**.
- The shipment involved **luxury agricultural goods and rare pipeweed strains**, falsely declared as low-grade produce.
- When Ironvein discovered the deception, Caldrin vanished from public trade records.

The debt now stands at:
- **Two chests of coin**, _or_
- **Caldrin’s left hand**, as a public warning.

Ironvein wants **compliance, not blood** — unless forced.
