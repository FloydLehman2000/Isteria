As the streets tighten and the greenery thins, the city’s pulse quickens. **Gildcross Markets** announces itself long before it’s seen—voices layered over voices, the clatter of coin, hawkers calling out deals in half a dozen dialects. Color floods the streets: striped awnings, glowing arcane signs, banners stitched with guild marks both official and forbidden.

The air is thick with **spices, smoke, sweat, and magic**. Taverns spill patrons into the road, street performers compete for attention beside fortune-tellers and relic-sellers, and somewhere beneath it all runs the constant murmur of deals being made. Here, information is currency, silence is suspicious, and everyone is either selling something—or pretending they aren’t.

Guild symbols are everywhere if you know how to look: chalk marks on stone, ribbon colors on doorframes, coins stamped just a little wrong. This is neutral ground in name only. The **Cratehand Guild’s outpost** watches from behind polished smiles, while unseen rivals count every exchange. In Gildcross, nothing stays secret for long—only buried.
