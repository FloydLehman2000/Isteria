## 🏰 Highthrone Bastion — City Overview

Highthrone Bastion is a vast metropolitan city enclosed by towering **red brick walls**, their age-darkened stone bearing the marks of centuries of trade, conquest, and control. Within those walls, the city blooms in contrast — **lush yellows and deep greens** spill across tiled rooftops, hanging gardens, painted shutters, and sun-washed courtyards. Gold-trimmed banners and living vines share space with iron balconies and crowded streets, giving the Bastion a strange warmth beneath its rigid order. From above, it looks alive — vibrant, thriving — and carefully contained.

The city is divided into **four wards**, each a city unto itself, bound together by law, trade, and ambition:
- **👑 [[Highthrone Bastion – Aureth Crown]]**  
    The Royal Ward — seat of the High Regent, noble estates, and the machinery of governance.
- **⚓ [[Highthrone Bastion – Rocky Edge]]**  
    The Shipping Ward — sprawling harbors, customs halls, warehouses, and guild-controlled piers.
- **🛍️ [[Highthrone Bastion – Gildcross Markets]]**  
    The Market Ward — bazaars, arcane vendors, food streets, information brokers, and hidden dealings.
- **🏘️ [[Highthrone Bastion – Greenery District]]**  
    The Residential Ward — homes, inns, taverns, shrines, and the quiet lives of the city’s people.
