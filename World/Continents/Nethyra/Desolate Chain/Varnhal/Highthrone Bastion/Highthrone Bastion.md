## 🏰 Highthrone Bastion — City Overview

Highthrone Bastion is a vast metropolitan city enclosed by towering **red brick walls**, their age-darkened stone bearing the marks of centuries of trade, conquest, and control. Within those walls, the city blooms in contrast — **lush yellows and deep greens** spill across tiled rooftops, hanging gardens, painted shutters, and sun-washed courtyards. Gold-trimmed banners and living vines share space with iron balconies and crowded streets, giving the Bastion a strange warmth beneath its rigid order. From above, it looks alive — vibrant, thriving — and carefully contained.

The city is divided into **four wards**, each a city unto itself, bound together by law, trade, and ambition:
- **👑 [[Highthrone Bastion – Aureth Crown]]**  
    The seat of power and quiet conspiracy, **Aureth Crown** is a ward of manicured estates, sun-warmed stone, and carefully maintained beauty. Noble villas rise behind ornate iron gates, their walls draped in flowering vines and gold-threaded banners. At its center stands the [[Highthrone Palace]], a regal structure of pale stone and living greenery where [[High Regent Caelith Veyron]] rules beneath constant protection from her Royal Guard. Though serene on the surface, Aureth Crown is where contracts are sealed, loyalties tested, and shadows stretch long behind polished smiles.
- **⚓ [[Highthrone Bastion – Rocky Edge]]**  
    Perched along the jagged rim of the floating island, **Rocky Edge** is the city’s gateway to the skies and seas. Vast docks, reinforced platforms, and towering cranes handle the constant flow of cargo, now including the revolutionary **airships of Isteria** that connect Highthrone Bastion to the wider continent of **Nethyra**. The air smells of salt, oil, and scorched metal. Hidden behind legitimate shipping houses is the secondary stronghold of the [[Ironvein Syndicate]], making Rocky Edge a place where commerce and coercion move side by side.
- **🛍️ [[Highthrone Bastion – Gildcross Markets]]**  
    A district that never truly rests, **Gildcross Markets** thrums with life at all hours. Lantern-lit streets twist through dense bazaars, crowded taverns, arcane shops, and food stalls heavy with spice and smoke. Information trades hands as readily as coin, and hidden passages connect public storefronts to private dealings. Nestled among merchant guildhouses lies a discreet [[Cratehand Guild outpost]], its influence felt through logistics and leverage rather than open presence. If something moves through Highthrone Bastion, it passes through Gildcross first.
- **🏘️ [[Highthrone Bastion – Greenery District]]**  
    The **Greenery District** is where the city breathes. Tree-lined streets wind between modest homes, shared courtyards, inns, and guard posts. Merchants, dockworkers, guards, and artisans return here at day’s end, filling the ward with evening chatter and lamplight. Though quieter than the other districts, unrest often simmers here first — when trade falters or guild tensions spill over, it is the Greenery District that feels it most keenly.

## Lore
---
Highthrone Bastion was the **first permanent city** founded by those who abandoned the endless cycle of the Quell Trials. When it became widely accepted that **Krallax could not be defeated**, many participants chose survival over glory, settling along the Desolate Chain and forming what began as a simple merchant town.

The city’s fate changed with the rise of a powerful mage — **Caelith Veyron**. Through arcane dominance, political maneuvering, and calculated restraint, she unified the growing settlement under a single authority and declared herself **High Regent**, establishing Highthrone Bastion as both a city-state and a symbol of endurance. To ensure prosperity, she forged early alliances with emerging trade powers, most notably the **Ironvein Syndicate** and the **Cratehand Guild**, granting them protection and operational space in exchange for resources, infrastructure, and loyalty.

Over time, cooperation fractured into rivalry. The two guilds expanded beyond the city — Ironvein consolidating control over **Varnhal**, and Cratehand dominating **Embrath** — yet both maintain bases within Highthrone Bastion. Their escalating struggle for trade dominance now shapes much of the city’s political tension, with High Regent Veyron balancing them carefully to prevent open conflict.

Highthrone Bastion stands as a testament to life after failure — a city built not on victory, but on ambition, compromise, and the refusal to fade away.
