Passing through , the harsh red brick of Highthrone’s outer wall gives way to something unexpectedly gentle. The streets open into a sprawl of **green-washed homes**, their walls overgrown with creeping ivy and flowering vines, balconies sagging under potted herbs and drying laundry. Stone paths curve instead of cutting straight, softened by moss and well-trod use rather than rigid design.

The air here smells of **bread, oil, and damp earth**. Guards mingle casually with civilians, helms unbuckled, spears resting at ease. Children dart between doorways, merchants argue softly over prices, and shrine bells chime faintly from tucked-away alcoves. This is where the city exhales—where people return after long shifts in the markets or docks, believing, at least for a few hours, that the Bastion’s power does not reach this far.

Yet even here, beneath the greenery and warmth, **eyes linger a moment too long**, and conversations hush when uniforms pass. Highthrone Bastion may be vibrant—but it is never unwatchful.

## Layout

### **🍺 The Mossbound Lantern (Inn)**

A low, wide inn wrapped in creeping ivy and hanging moss, its lanterns glowing soft green at night. The Mossbound Lantern is openly **welcoming to foreigners**, travelers, and “temporary residents,” which makes it popular with caravan guards, airship crew on leave, and newcomers still learning the city’s rhythms.

Inside, the floors are scuffed, the food is hearty, and the common room hums with quiet conversation rather than raucous noise. The innkeeper asks few questions and keeps meticulous keys. Notices in multiple languages hang near the bar—work postings, warnings, and the occasional coded message that regulars know better than to read aloud.

### **🕵️ The Truth Seekers’ Office**

Tucked above a cobbler’s shop is a narrow stone building marked only by a modest brass plaque: **THE TRUTH SEEKERS — Discreet Inquiries Taken**.

Inside, the space is cramped but organized. **Throrouth Whithood**, a sharp-eyed dwarf with ink-stained fingers and a mind like a ledger, handles contracts, evidence, and conclusions. **Bum**, an imposing female orc with crossed arms and a perpetual scowl, handles enforcement, protection, and “strong persuasion.” She says little—but when she does, people listen.

The Truth Seekers freelance as private investigators, missing-person specialists, and rumor verifiers. They don’t take jobs involving nobles without written guarantees, and they refuse anything tied directly to the palace—but they know far more about the city than they let on.

### **🛒 Root & Rafter Provisions (Small Store)**

A humble corner shop with a wooden sign carved in the shape of tangled roots. Root & Rafter sells **everyday necessities**: dried food, travel gear, candles, simple alchemical goods, and locally grown herbs from the district’s rooftop gardens.

The owner, an elderly human named Mary Singer, prides herself on knowing her customers by face, not name. She hears things—delivery delays, guard rotations, who’s fallen behind on rent—but shares information only if she trusts you, or if the coin is right. Adventurers are welcome, but watched carefully.

### **📜 Verdant Commons (Public Square)**

A circular square centered around a broad, old tree whose branches have been reinforced with stone supports. Here, **public announcements are read**, notices are nailed to boards, and criers deliver decrees from the palace or guilds.

By day, the Commons is busy with merchants, messengers, and locals airing grievances. By night, it becomes a quieter place—used for whispered meetings, recruitment attempts, and the occasional illegal announcement hastily torn down by guards. If something is about to change in the city, word of it almost always appears here first.

On the notice board you can find the following:
- **“CURFEW REMINDER”**  
    All non-essential travel is discouraged after the Sundering Bell. Citizens are advised to remain indoors during heavy mist hours.
- **“ROYAL DECREE”**  
    Unauthorized spellcasting within Aureth Crown boundaries is punishable by fine or detainment.
- **“LABORERS NEEDED”**  
    Repairs underway on residential rooftops. Experience with climbing or levitation a plus.
- **“THE MISTS ARE WATCHING”**  
    Scrawled in charcoal. Half-smudged, half-scratched out.
- **“IRONVEIN BLEEDS”**  
    Written hastily, crossed out twice, then written again smaller beneath.
