## Ground Floor

**A1. COURTYARD OF HIGHTHRONE BASTION**

>A wide, immaculate courtyard stretches before the Inner Palace, its pale stone paths cutting through trimmed gardens, shallow reflecting pools, and weathered statues draped in ivy. The space feels open yet controlled — quiet footsteps, distant voices, and the constant presence of watchful guards give the air a restrained, ceremonial tension.

Little happens here beyond passing patrols, waiting petitioners, and the steady flow of messengers entering and leaving the palace. It is a place meant to impress and observe, not linger — those who stay too long draw polite scrutiny, and those who act out of place are noticed immediately.

**A2. HALLWAY TOWARD THE THRONE ROOM**

>An imposing corridor stretches ahead, its vaulted ceiling supported by carved stone pillars and draped in gold-trimmed banners bearing the sigil of Highthrone Bastion. Marble statues of past victories and allegorical figures line the walls, their stone eyes seeming to follow every step.

Royal guards stand at measured intervals along the hall, motionless and silent, turning the passage into a gauntlet of scrutiny. Every footstep echoes here, reminding all who pass that this road leads not just to a throne, but to judgment.

**A3 — Advisors’ Antechamber**

>A heavily guarded chamber where royal advisors gather before entering the throne room. Polished stone benches line the walls, and tall drapes soften the echoes of hushed conversations. The air here is tense and perfumed — a place of whispered strategy, restrained egos, and careful waiting.

If the characters linger, they may overhear fragments of quiet discussions about **trade disputes**, **guild influence**, or **unrest in the outer islands**, but nothing is spoken plainly. This is a room where information is exchanged through implication rather than confession, and where even silence feels measured.

**A4 — Armory Caretaker’s Post**

>A compact stone office cluttered with weapon racks, ledgers, and neatly stacked crates of spare gear. The scent of oiled steel and treated leather hangs heavy in the air, and every item is meticulously labeled and catalogued. This room serves as both a checkpoint and a nerve center, ensuring the palace guard is always armed, uniformed, and ready.

A sharp-eyed caretaker or quartermaster (Clark Lander) is usually present, keeping careful watch over who enters and leaves. Any missing equipment is noted quickly — not out of loyalty, but because mistakes here tend to have consequences.

**A5 — Merchant Exchange Room**

> A secure, well-lit chamber lined with lockboxes, sealed crates, and heavy tables etched with chalk sigils used to verify shipments. Everything here is catalogued twice — once in ink, once in code — before being moved deeper into the palace or sent back out across the Chain.

While present, the party can **overhear a tense, low-voiced exchange** between two clerks and a guild factor. A shipment marked for the Crown has been **intentionally delayed**, its seal altered to shift blame between the **Ironvein Syndicate** and the **Cratehand Guild**. The discussion reveals that both guilds are quietly testing how much interference the Crown will tolerate before stepping in.

If the players act, they could:
- **Steal a coded manifest** identifying which guild currently controls specific docks and routes.
- **Intercept a crate** containing high-value trade goods meant to tip the balance of a disputed contract.
- **Learn the name of a neutral merchant house** being pressured by both sides — a potential ally, target, or leverage point in the trade war.

Nothing here looks like open conflict — but every crate moved is another blade placed carefully in someone’s back.

**A6 — Guard Armory & Training Ground**

> Racks of polished weapons line the walls while guards rotate through sparring drills in the open center of the room, steel clashing in practiced, efficient rhythms. The air smells of oil, sweat, and sharpened iron, and every movement here speaks of discipline drilled to the point of instinct.

A keen observer might notice **select weapons marked with a discreet sigil**—arms reserved not for palace defense, but for deployment elsewhere in the city. Overheard banter between guards hints at **recent reinforcements sent to the docks and markets**, suggesting the Crown is quietly preparing for unrest tied to the ongoing trade war.

**A7 — Administrative Offices**

> Long rows of desks, stacked ledgers, and ink-stained hands fill this cramped maze of offices, where the true machinery of the palace turns quietly and relentlessly. Clerks murmur over tariffs, scribes copy decrees at a relentless pace, and messengers come and go with sealed documents bound for every ward of the city.

If the party lingers, they may overhear **coded references to “adjusted port fees” and “delayed permits”**—bureaucratic language masking economic pressure being applied unevenly across the city. A misplaced ledger or half-finished report could reveal **which guilds are being favored, which are being strangled**, and just how deliberately the Crown is fueling the trade war without ever drawing a blade.

**A8 — Grand Rotunda & Throne Hall**

> The Grand Rotunda is a soaring circular chamber of stone, glass, and living greenery, where **gold-veined pillars** rise to a domed ceiling open to filtered daylight. Vines trail down from high balconies, banners ripple gently in the air, and the acoustics carry every footstep with deliberate gravity. At its center stands **the Throne of Yureth**, elevated and ever-occupied—**High Regent Caelith Veyron** is rarely absent, watching the hall like a patient architect overseeing her design.

This space serves as the palace’s ceremonial core, hosting **royal addresses, proclamations, and formal audiences**, while also acting as the central junction between levels and wings of the palace. Entry is tightly controlled: only those listed on the **daily guest registry** may pass the inner guards. Any who arrive unlisted are redirected to **A7 — Administrative Offices**, where their purpose is scrutinized, documented, and—if deemed worthy—added to the Queen’s schedule at her discretion.

 **Entering the Grand Rotunda WITH Permission**
- **Guard behavior:** Royal Guards stand at attention but allow passage without question.
- **Atmosphere:** The hall goes quiet as the party enters; attention subtly shifts toward them.
- **Access:** The party may approach designated audience points, observe court proceedings, or be formally addressed by a herald.
- **Consequences:** Their presence is **recorded**—names, time, and stated purpose logged by palace scribes. Whatever they say or do here will be remembered.

---
**Entering the Grand Rotunda WITHOUT Permission**
- **Immediate response:** Guards intercept the party before reaching the central floor. Weapons are not drawn at first, but hands are never far from hilts.
- **Escalation:**
    - Refusal to comply results in **detainment** and escort to **A6 (Guard Armory & Training)** or temporary holding cells (B6).
    - Aggression or magic triggers a **lockdown**—doors seal, arcane wards flare, and reinforcements arrive within moments.
- **Political fallout:** Even if released, the party is marked as **disruptive**—future access becomes harder, and certain officials may refuse dealings.

**A9 — Palace Kitchen**

> A constant hum of activity fills these expansive kitchens, where roaring hearths, clattering cookware, and shouted orders blend into organized chaos. Cooks, servers, and supply runners work in overlapping shifts, preparing meals for nobles, guards, and the Queen herself—no matter the hour.

If the party blends in or listens closely, they may overhear **unguarded conversations**: gossip about noble disputes, rumors of sudden banquets or canceled feasts, and quiet complaints about **shipments delayed or ingredients redirected**—small clues that hint at shifting priorities and unrest within the palace.

**A10 — Guest Chambers of State**

> These luxurious suites are reserved for foreign dignitaries, high-ranking envoys, and individuals the Crown wishes to impress—or keep close. Rich fabrics, polished stone, and carefully curated greenery soften the rooms, while subtle arcane comforts regulate temperature, light, and privacy.

Though opulent, the chambers are never truly unobserved. Attentive staff come and go at odd hours, and faint magical wards ensure guests are **protected… and monitored**. A perceptive visitor might notice doors opened just a little too quickly, or questions asked that feel less like hospitality and more like assessment.

**A11 — Restricted Archives**

> A silent, heavily warded chamber containing sealed records never meant for public eyes. Iron-bound shelves hold **blackmail ledgers, secret trade accords, falsified genealogies, and names erased from official history**. Access is limited to a handful of trusted officials, and even they must log every document touched.

Disturbing even a single record here risks triggering **silent alarms**—not immediate, but patient. Anyone who reads too much may find their secrets known in return.

| **6** | Hidden behind a false panel is a slim case etched with sigils of silence. Inside are two short profiles, clearly not meant for archives—only for **use**.<br><br>- **Crane (Ironvein Syndicate):**  <br>    Crane suffers from a **progressive nerve condition** in his left arm and shoulder, the result of prolonged exposure to arcane experiments. The pain is severe and worsening; on bad days he relies on magical suppressants from his 2nd in command, Natali. Without them, his grip falters and his temper fractures. The dossier notes his **deep fear of appearing weak**, especially before subordinates—any public challenge exploiting this could provoke reckless decisions or a violent overreaction.<br>    <br>- **Veyla Cratch (Cratehand Guild):**  <br>    Veyla maintains a flawless public persona, but the records confirm her **secret attachment to her younger sister**, believed dead and officially erased from Cratehand rolls. In truth, the sister lives under protection in the Greenery District, her existence known only to Veyla and a handful of palace agents. Veyla’s composure collapses when this subject is threatened; she has rerouted entire shipments and broken contracts to keep the secret buried.<br><br>A final marginal note reads:  <br>_“Neither can be ruled—only steered.”_ |


**A12 — Intelligence Quiet Rooms**

> Windowless and softly lit, these rooms are designed to swallow sound and memory alike. Palace intelligence conducts interrogations, private negotiations, and delicate “corrections” here, far from witnesses or record. The air is thick with old tension, and even the walls seem to listen.

Those who linger may experience **headaches, disorientation, or the unsettling feeling of being watched**, as subtle enchantments ensure conversations inside never fully leave.

**A13 — Sealed Descent**

> Hidden behind an unassuming wall, this **secret doorway** leads downward into the palace’s most forbidden depths. Powerful magical wards reinforce the stone, and Royal Guards are stationed here at all times—rotating frequently, never alone.

The door opens only under specific arcane conditions or by direct command of the High Regent. Those who discover it without authorization will quickly learn that **curiosity is treated as treason** within these halls.

## Upper Level

**B1 — Inner Palace Gatehouse**

> A massive, fortified checkpoint seals access to the Inner Palace. Polished stone arches frame reinforced iron gates etched with warding sigils, while elevated guard posts overlook every approach. Entry is tightly regulated—names are checked against sealed lists, papers inspected, and spells quietly woven to test intent and identity.

Those who pass are ushered through with clipped efficiency. Those who do not are detained politely but firmly, escorted away under the watchful eyes of the Royal Guard. Even speaking too loudly here draws attention; this is a place where authority is not shouted—it is **assumed**.
