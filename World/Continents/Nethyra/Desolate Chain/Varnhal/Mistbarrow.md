## Lore
---
Mistbarrow stands as the last flicker of habitation in the wild and treacherous reaches of North Varnhal, hemmed in by choking swamps, dense shadowed forests, and the sluggish river that marks its southern edge. To its northwest looms **Ironfell**, the abandoned fighting arena where echoes of past battles still haunt the stands. Northward lies the **Fallen Sanctum of Sha’Korath**, a once-revered temple now drowned in darkness and ruin. To the northeast rises **Skaldrin’s Watch**, a grim prison that holds adventurers who have broken the Trials’ laws or endangered the civilians of Isteria. Isolated yet stubborn, Mistbarrow endures — a damp bastion of trade, rumor, and uneasy refuge in a land where the fog itself seems to watch.

## Layout
---
**Region:** North Varnhal  
**Population:** ~2,800  
**Primary Allegiance:** Baron Edrin Mornvale  
**Patron Deity (Fading):** **Primara, The Prime Architect**  
**Known For:** Clockwork craftwork, peat spirits, fog-cut lantern glass, swamp-foraged remedies, and the stubborn preservation of divine-mechanical lore.

### Top down layout:
- **Southern Boundary:** Silverfen River, used for trade and travel. River barges bring goods from further inland and carry swamp bounty out to larger ports.
- **North–South Spine:** The main boardwalk, elevated and wide enough for carts, cutting straight through town to the northern gate.
- **Eastern Quarter:** Merchant craft-shops, the Cogwheel Ward. The Aetherspire rises here.
- **Western Quarter:** Residential stilthouses, smaller piers, and the burial mound.
- **Perimeter:** Defensive wall of mossy swampstone with four lantern-lit gates. Watchposts stand at corners, their lamps glowing violet in the mist.

___
### The Central Spine
A wooden boardwalk from the southern river to the northern gate, lined with merchant stalls, fishmongers, and herbalists.  
**Key Feature:** The **Fogweave Market**, where rope awnings and netted goods sway gently in the damp breeze. Here you can buy swamp-caught fish, bundles of marsh herbs, simple tools, and stranger curios if you know where to look.

### The Crooked Keel (Tavern & Gathering Hall)
The Crooked Keel leans eastward, its timber frame warped by damp fog and swamp-soaked soil. The mismatched planks reinforce it like a patchwork quilt, and its roof droops like the hull of an old ship. Inside, the scent of burning peat mingles with spice and ale. Lanterns sway on low beams, casting drunken shadows over tables. Floorboards tilt unpredictably — regulars bet on whether a stranger’s drink will slide away before they finish it.

**Notable NPCs:**
- **Torren Bale** – Broad-shouldered ex-riverman turned tavernkeep, quiet but watchful, a well-oiled crossbolt hanging above the hearth.
- **Kara Venn** – Silver-tongued cardsharp and storyteller, trades in secrets more than coin, always one story ahead of you.

---
### Baron’s House (Mornvale Keep)
Perched on a rocky rise to the north, the keep overlooks both swamp and river. Its interior is all velvet drapes, polished swampstone, and silver-gilt mechanical locks. Rumor has it the Mornvales keep **a hidden chamber of relics** from before the Ascension.

**Notable NPCs:*
- **Baron Edrin Mornvale** – A patient and calculating ruler, rumored to be an old ally of Primara’s clergy before the gods faded.
- **Captain Reva Halvorn** – Head of the keep’s guard, keeps close tabs on adventurers in town.

**Hooks:**
- Captain Reva is convinced someone is **creating dangerous devices in the Gearspire** and wants proof.

### The Gearspire (Church of Primara)

A towering blend of cathedral and workshop, the Gearspire’s upper rings disappear into the fog, its crown of turning gears and brass lenses glinting faintly in lantern light. The tower’s great clockwork face keeps perfect time, though no one knows who built it.

Inside, polished stilts of swampwood support rows of pews beside long workbenches littered with tools, diagrams, and fragments of pre-Ascension relics. Worshippers move between prayer and craft seamlessly, reciting invocations as they adjust tiny gearworks or polish celestial lenses. A **mechanical choir** of pipes and chimes hums softly during sermons, producing harmonics felt more in the chest than the ears.

**Notable NPCs:**
- **High Artificer Maros Vell** – Stern, brilliant, and half-machine/half-human; his polished brass prosthetics hum faintly with power.
- **Apprentice Eleanor Huddleston** – Wide-eyed tinkerer convinced she’s found a piece of the **Final Project** hidden in the swamp.
