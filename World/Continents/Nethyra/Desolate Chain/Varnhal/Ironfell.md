## Lore
---
Ironfell was once the most infamous bloodsport in the Desolate Chain.  
Officially, it was advertised as a celebration of martial skill — “the proving ground of the brave.” In truth, its combatants were **adventurers kidnapped during their Quell Trials** or in the wilds, dragged to the arena under false charges or complete secrecy. Many vanished without a trace; their loved ones were told they’d perished during their trials.

The fights were held for the entertainment of the wealthy and well-connected, often with wagers so large they could topple small kingdoms. It ended abruptly after a scandal exposed the kidnappings… or so the public believes.
### ⚙️ Current State
Though officially closed, Ironfell is not abandoned. The gates are sealed in daylight, but at night, torchlight flickers in the stands and muffled cheers drift on the wind. A shadowy group — perhaps one of the trade war guilds, perhaps something older — is keeping the fights alive for an even smaller, more exclusive audience.

## Layout
---

Ironfell is built vertically, its true purpose hidden beneath layers of stone and iron. From the outside, it appears to be a sealed and abandoned arena, but below the sand lies a fully operational stronghold.
### 🔻 Lower Sublevel — The Ironvein Core
The lowest level of Ironfell serves as the base of operations for the [[Ironvein Syndicate]]. This floor is carved directly into the bedrock, reinforced with heavy iron supports and sound-dampening stone.

Here, the Syndicate coordinates logistics, communications, and enforcement. Vaulted chambers store ledgers, contraband, and sealed contracts marked in iron wax. Private offices line the inner ring — including the command chamber of **Crane**, where decisions are made that ripple far beyond the arena.

Access to this floor is tightly controlled. Guards are Syndicate loyalists, not hired muscle, and trespassers do not leave.
#### 🔺 Upper Sublevel — Cells & Training Works
Above the Core lies a brutal and functional level dedicated to **containment and preparation**.

- **Cells:** Iron-barred holding chambers for abducted combatants, debt prisoners, and those awaiting their next match. Some cells are solitary; others are packed tightly to break morale.
- **Training Grounds:** Reinforced practice halls where fighters are drilled, tested, and shaped into spectacles. Instructors emphasize endurance and obedience as much as combat skill.
- **Workshops:** Mechanized forges and arcane rigs used to maintain weapons, armor, and arena devices. Traps, lifts, and kill-mechanisms are assembled and repaired here before being raised to the arena floor above.

This level hums constantly with movement — chains, grinding gears, shouted orders, and the dull impact of steel on flesh.
#### ⚔️ Arena Level — The Ironfell Pit
Above ground sits the arena itself: a massive stone coliseum ringed with sealed spectator stands. The sand is stained dark beneath layers of fresh earth, and hidden mechanisms beneath the floor allow the terrain to shift mid-combat.

By day, the arena is silent and sealed. By night, it awakens — torches lit, blood spilled, and fortunes wagered behind closed doors.

## Homebase — Ironvein Syndicate
---

Ironfell is one half of the Ironvein Syndicate’s power — the **hidden half**.

From this underground stronghold, the Syndicate conducts its illegal operations: bloodsport, forced labor, blackmail, and the quiet removal of inconvenient individuals. Ironfell allows Ironvein to profit from secrecy, fear, and spectacle, all while maintaining plausible deniability.

Crane oversees Ironfell personally, but is not always here since he has a lot of dealings in the homebase in Highthrone Bastion as well. Decisions made here are swift and final. Fighters are assets, not people. Losses are calculated. Survivors are leveraged.
### Dual Seat of Power
The Syndicate’s influence is deliberately split between two locations:

- **Ironfell** — The shadow arm  
  - Illegal fights  
  - Kidnappings and disappearances  
  - Black-market weapons and machinery  
  - Enforcement and intimidation  

- **Highthrone Bastion** — The public arm  
  - Legitimate trade and merchant dealings  
  - Contracts, shipping, and investments  
  - Political influence and noble patronage  
  - Clean ledgers and respectable fronts  

This separation allows Ironvein to thrive in both worlds. If Ironfell is ever exposed, Highthrone Bastion remains untarnished. If Highthrone faces scrutiny, Ironfell continues unseen.
### Operational Philosophy
Ironvein believes in control through structure. Every fighter, guard, and merchant knows their role — and only their role. Information is compartmentalized. Loyalty is rewarded. Failure is buried.

Ironfell is not just a location; it is a pressure valve. It absorbs the violence, ambition, and excess that cannot exist in polite society — and converts it into power.
